Mementos by ITC Hotels is a collection of luxury hotels that offer the rarest of luxuries: 
great memories.
Every detail of the Mementos experience is designed to create exquisite moments, unique to each destination and transform them into something truly unforgettable. So that from the time you arrive, till well after you depart, 
every moment stays with you.




























ONE SMALL STEP FOR YOU,
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR YOUR MEMORIES
The desire to try new things or live the old ones once more. 
To do nothing or everything?
All at the tips of your fingers, and sometimes the toes too.


































THE ART OF CHANGING FOOD INTO MEMORIES
At our collection of restaurants, you’ll have the luxury to relish each dish twice. 
Once when you eat it and
once when you look back on the time you ate it.


































HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SO MOVED
THAT YOU COULDN'T MOVE?
Every experience is crafted to be memorable, and that’s how we’ve briefed our sunsets too. 
But as memories often do, their beauty sometimes surprises us too.



















      
        THE MEMORIES ARE IN THE DETAILS
      
      
    






















      
        MEMENTOS EXPERIENCES
      
      
    






We design every experience to be a warm & memorable one. The well-being programs are designed to rejuvenate & relax, while in-retreat experiences provide a range of activities to indulge in. The F&B experience is exceptional, offering gourmet delights & immersive dining experiences. The city getaways allow you to explore the surrounding areas. All-in-all, every location provides a transformative experience that nourishes your every sense.
























      
        MEMENTOS AMBASSADOR
      
      
    






Mementos Ambassadors are the ultimate memory-makers. With their exceptional skills, they help you create unforgettable experiences across our properties. They ensure that every moment counts, by providing personalized services, guiding you to make the most of your stay and unfolding memories that last a lifetime
























      
        MEMENTOS SIGNATURE SCENT
      
      
    






We’ve bottled memories - this signature scent can be found across our properties. It’s an earthy fragrance that takes you on a journey through nature. With top notes of Sage, Bergamot, and Rosemary, it's as if you're standing in the midst of a lush garden. The heart contains a unique aroma of Cinnamon, adding a sweet & warm touch. This evokes a sense of comfort & indulgence, & a momentary escape down memory lane
























      
        MEMENTOS SONATA
      
      
    






The auditory experience is especially composed for Mementos. A genre of music with the elements of smooth jazz, lounge and Indian instrumentation, making it the perfect background score to your memories. Mementos sonata will soon be available on playlist near you.
























      
        MEMENTOS GUIDE
      
      
    






Discover the city's best experiences with our immersive guidebook. Pick and choose an itinerary that ensures an unforgettable, authentic adventure. Curated tours showcase food, culture, and more. Let our guidebook be your key to uncovering every destination's highlights

        New Delhi
      
      
    






It’s rather difficult to slot Delhi - whether Old Delhi or New Delhi - in one particular category. To some it is a “city that never sleeps” dotted with glass-mirrored skyscrapers which house stylishly luxurious offices of multinational companies, to others it’s a metropolis with tree-lined boulevards while to many more it brings back pleasurable memories of bustling streets and bazaars of Chandni Chowk.
The capital city of India, Delhi has also been the principal city for many dynasties and empires over the centuries. Home to communities from all over the country, it is indeed a melting pot of cultures.  
Showcasing delectably different experiences, the city is the perfect example of encapsulation of two very different worlds, the 'old' and the 'new', each representing its own vibrancy and prominence. Take your pick and Delhi, whether old or new or in-between, will never disappoint you.

        Gurugram
      
      
    






Located in the state of Haryana, Gurugram has made a phenomenal rise from being a hinterland to one of the prime commercial hubs in India. The scale and pace of urbanization spurred the area’s per capita income to third highest in India, and the city, to its credit, houses headquarters of more than half of the Fortune 500 companies.
Gurugram shares proximity with New Delhi and figures as a prominent part of NCR agglomeration. A modern establishment with several skyscrapers adorning the skyline of the city including great-value business hotels in Gurugram, it opens colourful avenues to Delhi’s rich tourist attractions. Its young urbanism is complemented by a trendy mall culture complete with cafes, bars and restaurants. DLF Cyber Hub is one-stop for outing, amusement and shopping, and promises an engaging nightlife to Gurugram residents and travellers alike. ‘Kingdom of Dreams’ is another popular destination thronged by crowd for its larger than life plays and performances.  
Once started off as a BPO and IT outsourcing hub, the city has come a long way to become a centre for major domains as well as niche areas. The city also has manufacturing plants of Maruti Suzuki, Hero and GE. This dazzling business potential of the city has always seen heightened interest in real estate and has established Gurugram’s status as the 'Millennium City'.

        Mumbai
      
      
    






Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is the capital city of the state of Maharashtra and the financial hub of India. Also home to the country’s famed film industry, the stock exchange and several commercial organisations, it is often known as the ‘city of dreams’, with thousands arriving in each day hoping to make it big.
The name ‘Mumbai’ - derived from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā is the name of the patron goddess  Mumbadevi of the native Agri, Koli and Somvanshi Kshatriya communities—meaning ""mother"" in the local Marathi language, which is the official language of the state.

The culture of this metro city is a boisterous blend of cuisines, languages, food, fine arts, cinema and festivals. The city-dwellers, often labelled as the 'Mumbaikars', lead a fast-paced life and spend a significant time of their lives commuting from one place to another. Apart from being known as the 'film city of India'. it is one of the biggest metropolitan cities in the country, promising a high-adrenaline, foot-tapping, diverse city life to all its inhabitants.

        Goa
      
      
    






Splashed by the waters of the Arabian Sea on the Konkan coast, Goa is the smallest state in India by area and the fourth smallest by population. It was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years, beginning with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. Its culture has evolved as a colourful blend of Portuguese and Konkan influences. The architecture and décor of its Portuguese mansions have still been preserved at various places, especially in Fontainhas, the old Latin Quarter in Panjim, Goa’s capital.
Goa has attracted tourists from all over India and across the world, much loved for its easy-going lifestyle and hospitable people. The concept of ‘sussegad’ is believed to define the prevailing mood in Goa – a relaxed, laid-back approach to life that happily denies entry to the very idea of stress or strain. The beaches are amongst the finest in India, with clean sands and mostly gentle breakers.

The imposing churches of old Goa are a fascinating repository of its colonial past, while its famed night life, bars, restaurants, beach shacks and flea markets are entirely contemporary.

        Agra
      
      
    






Sitting at the edge of the majestic Yamuna River, Agra was once the glorious capital of the mighty Mughal Empire at the peak of its power. However, in today’s world, Agra is synonymous with one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal.  It is a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur. The legacy of the Mughal Empire has left a magnificent fort and a liberal sprinkling of fascinating tombs and mausoleums; and there’s also fun to be had in the bustling bazars (marketplaces). The examples of art and culture in this historic city are not only breathtaking but are also mirrors of the artistic talents of the Indian population during the grand past. 
The city has its unique style of traditional paintings, folk dances, folk music and embroideries. Agra is also a popular shopping destination where you can buy marble with inlay work, semi-precious stones, jewellery and handicrafts. The city is also very famous for its superior quality leather goods like bags, belts and jackets.

        Coimbatore
      
      
    






Ruled by the Cheras between the 1st & 4th Centuries, Coimbatore was part of the Kongu Nadu and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the west coast and Tamil Nadu. It subsequently witnessed the rule of other dynasties which included among others, the medieval Cholas, the Vijayanagara Empire, and the Kingdom of Mysore. Coimbatore originally derives its name from Kosamputhur (a place where Kosar tribes lived), which became Koyamuthur and then eventually, Coimbatore under the British Raj.  Culturally rich and diverse, the city hosts various art, dance and music concerts every year. It houses a number of museums and art galleries like G.D. Naidu Museum & Industrial Exhibition, H. A. Gass Forest Museum, Government Museum, Kadhi Gandhi Gallery and Kasthuri Srinivasan Art Gallery and Textile Museum. The city is now a major textile and manufacturing hub in Tamil Nadu.

Find yourself amidst the swaying palms and the sea breeze in Port Blair. The capital city sits on one of the 37 inhabited islands of the 572 that make up the stunning union territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Situated just a few hours away from the mainland, the islands open up a portal to a different world. From historical sites to a diverse and lush flora and fauna, this site once known for the infamous Kalapani - a British era prison used to house freedom fighters and political prisoners, is home to a rich blend of history, culture, and adventure.

Classy corporate meets, joyous social gatherings





ITC Hotels & Welcomhotels have long been renowned for magnificent gatherings of discerning people, whether corporate events or social celebrations. Conferences, symposia, board meetings, product launches and more can be hosted with great aplomb. There is a huge variety of spaces and hosting capacities – both indoors and outdoors – backed up by superb décor, award-winning cuisines, the latest audio-visual and technical support and business services.
 
Parties and celebrations take on a radiant sheen . The sheer grandeur of the hotel is the first moment of admiration . The décor, ambience and signature cuisines make the celebration ever more memorable.The warmth of intuitive service adds a special aura to the experience.
 
The ITC Grand Chola in Chennai can host up to 3,000 guests in the Rajendra Ballroom alone. The adjoining properties in Kolkata – ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal – are ideal venues for large scale events. In contrast, an offsite of 100 guests at Welcomhotel The Savoy in Mussoorie will be enveloped in the old world charm of a century-old property. The conference or celebration can be under the swaying palms by the sandy beaches of Welcomhotel Kences Palm Beach at Mamallapuram. At every hotel, the possibilities are endless and so is the exultation.

A love story that affects humanity. The story of us, as individuals, and our bond with Mother Nature.

Today, and every day, let's strengthen the love. Show our planet that we care, take affirmative action that nurtures nature.

World's First Twelve LEED Zero Carbon Certified Hotels

We believe that a better tomorrow starts with the changes we make today. This vision is brought alive by our commitment to sustainable practices, right from the structural design of our hotels to their daily functioning.
This philosophy is exemplified by twelve of our iconic hotels – ITC Windsor - Bengaluru, ITC Grand Chola - Chennai, ITC Gardenia - Bengaluru, Welcomhotel Bengaluru, Welcomhotel Guntur, Welcomhotel Chennai, ITC Mughal - Agra, Welcomhotel Coimbatore, Sheraton New Delhi, ITC Grand Central - Mumbai, ITC Maratha - Mumbai and ITC Rajputana - Jaipur are now certified as the world’s first Twelve LEED Zero Carbon – Certified hotels.













      
        World's First three LEED Zero Water Certified Hotels
      
      
    
















 ITC Mughal Resort & Spa, Agra 










 ITC Sonar, Kolkata 










 ITC Rajputana, Jaipur 







Water is a precious resource and recycling is a responsibility we must uphold to ensure a sustainable future for our planet. ITC Mughal, Agra & ITC Sonar, Kolkata & ITC Rajputana, Jaipur have become the first three ITC hotels to be LEED Zero Water Certified. The certification verifies net zero goals and signals market leadership in the built environment. The hotels have been ensuring that their water requirements are offset by the use of sustainable practices such as recycling water and rainwater harvesting













      
        Key Sustainability Initiatives
      
      
    






















      
        LEED Platinum Certified
      
      
    






ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel chains in the world to receive the coveted LEED Platinum Certification for all hotels. LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is amongst the world’s most widely used systems for rating green buildings with platinum being the highest certification.
























      
        Energy Efficiency
      
      
    






Major portion of electrical consumption is met through renewable sources
























      
        Working towards a single use plastic free environment 
      
      
    






Guided by ethos of Responsible Luxury, ITC Hotels is continually striving towards the goal of operating in a single–use-plastic free environment. Towards this we have reduced the usage of single-use-plastic from 150 touch points across hotel operations. This has helped eliminate an estimated 2.5 Lakh Kg plastic per year.
























      
        Sunya Aqua
      
      
    






SunyaAqua - Zero Mile water is treated & purified within the hotel using advanced technology, while conforming to Indian standards for safety and purity.

        Leadership in sustainability
      
      
    






ITC Hotels was named as the 2021 USGBC Regional Leadership Award recipient by the U.S. Green Building Council. This is a global recognition that celebrates organisations around the world who are using green building and sustainable practices to improve the quality of life for those around them.



















				ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad
			






      
        Efficient design & sustainable materials
      
      
    






 The extensive use of natural light within ITC Hotels help in creating comfortable spaces for our guests while lowering electricity consumption. ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad for instance, is aligned in a way that maximises its interaction with the sun, allowing more sunlight into the property throughout the day.

Mementos by ITC Hotels is a collection of luxury hotels that offer the rarest of luxuries: 
great memories.
Every detail of the Mementos experience is designed to create exquisite moments, unique to each destination and transform them into something truly unforgettable. So that from the time you arrive, till well after you depart, 
every moment stays with you.




























ONE SMALL STEP FOR YOU,
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR YOUR MEMORIES
The desire to try new things or live the old ones once more. 
To do nothing or everything?
All at the tips of your fingers, and sometimes the toes too.


































THE ART OF CHANGING FOOD INTO MEMORIES
At our collection of restaurants, you’ll have the luxury to relish each dish twice. 
Once when you eat it and
once when you look back on the time you ate it.


































HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SO MOVED
THAT YOU COULDN'T MOVE?
Every experience is crafted to be memorable, and that’s how we’ve briefed our sunsets too. 
But as memories often do, their beauty sometimes surprises us too.



















      
        THE MEMORIES ARE IN THE DETAILS
      
      
    






















      
        MEMENTOS EXPERIENCES
      
      
    






We design every experience to be a warm & memorable one. The well-being programs are designed to rejuvenate & relax, while in-retreat experiences provide a range of activities to indulge in. The F&B experience is exceptional, offering gourmet delights & immersive dining experiences. The city getaways allow you to explore the surrounding areas. All-in-all, every location provides a transformative experience that nourishes your every sense.
























      
        MEMENTOS AMBASSADOR
      
      
    






Mementos Ambassadors are the ultimate memory-makers. With their exceptional skills, they help you create unforgettable experiences across our properties. They ensure that every moment counts, by providing personalized services, guiding you to make the most of your stay and unfolding memories that last a lifetime
























      
        MEMENTOS SIGNATURE SCENT
      
      
    






We’ve bottled memories - this signature scent can be found across our properties. It’s an earthy fragrance that takes you on a journey through nature. With top notes of Sage, Bergamot, and Rosemary, it's as if you're standing in the midst of a lush garden. The heart contains a unique aroma of Cinnamon, adding a sweet & warm touch. This evokes a sense of comfort & indulgence, & a momentary escape down memory lane
























      
        MEMENTOS SONATA
      
      
    






The auditory experience is especially composed for Mementos. A genre of music with the elements of smooth jazz, lounge and Indian instrumentation, making it the perfect background score to your memories. Mementos sonata will soon be available on playlist near you.
























      
        MEMENTOS GUIDE
      
      
    






Discover the city's best experiences with our immersive guidebook. Pick and choose an itinerary that ensures an unforgettable, authentic adventure. Curated tours showcase food, culture, and more. Let our guidebook be your key to uncovering every destination's highlights

Classy corporate meets, joyous social gatherings





ITC Hotels & Welcomhotels have long been renowned for magnificent gatherings of discerning people, whether corporate events or social celebrations. Conferences, symposia, board meetings, product launches and more can be hosted with great aplomb. There is a huge variety of spaces and hosting capacities – both indoors and outdoors – backed up by superb décor, award-winning cuisines, the latest audio-visual and technical support and business services.
 
Parties and celebrations take on a radiant sheen . The sheer grandeur of the hotel is the first moment of admiration . The décor, ambience and signature cuisines make the celebration ever more memorable.The warmth of intuitive service adds a special aura to the experience.
 
The ITC Grand Chola in Chennai can host up to 3,000 guests in the Rajendra Ballroom alone. The adjoining properties in Kolkata – ITC Sonar and ITC Royal Bengal – are ideal venues for large scale events. In contrast, an offsite of 100 guests at Welcomhotel The Savoy in Mussoorie will be enveloped in the old world charm of a century-old property. The conference or celebration can be under the swaying palms by the sandy beaches of Welcomhotel Kences Palm Beach at Mamallapuram. At every hotel, the possibilities are endless and so is the exultation.

The décor is stunning, thematic and customisable, while the award-winning cuisines will win appreciation in every quarter. The latest audio-visual and technical support are fully available. The happiest memories are made of this.

The hotel has been built at the optimum angle to the sun’s movement, reducing power consumption for cooling. The shimmering interiors celebrate the cultural wealth of the region, using lac bangles and bidri work as colourful elements. Geometric interpretations of the facets of the diamond are seen as motifs in the guest rooms and corridors. The hotel takes its guests on culinary explorations that embrace local, national and global gastronomy. The conference and banqueting spaces are among the largest in the city, each venue a distinct presence.

The rounded edges and colour of the exterior of the hotel find an echo in the distinctive boulders of Hyderabad. The textiles, ceramics, stone and glass used to create this magnificent edifice resonate beautifully with the cultural identity of the city and the region. This hotel exudes an indescribable aura of subtle finesse.
























      
        Sustainability
      
      
    






GRIHA 5 star & LEED® platinum rated hotel is constructed at a specific alignment to optimize its interaction with the sun. This maintains the correct balance of sunshine and shade during different times of the day, enabling effective cooling of the hotel. So our guests feel less strained and so does our planet. Sustainability efforts have led to significant reduction in water and electricity demand.

An Eternal Love Story
A love story that affects humanity. The story of us, as individuals, and our bond with Mother Nature.

Today, and every day, let's strengthen the love. Show our planet that we care, take affirmative action that nurtures nature.

World's First Twelve LEED Zero Carbon Certified Hotels

We believe that a better tomorrow starts with the changes we make today. This vision is brought alive by our commitment to sustainable practices, right from the structural design of our hotels to their daily functioning.
This philosophy is exemplified by twelve of our iconic hotels – ITC Windsor - Bengaluru, ITC Grand Chola - Chennai, ITC Gardenia - Bengaluru, Welcomhotel Bengaluru, Welcomhotel Guntur, Welcomhotel Chennai, ITC Mughal - Agra, Welcomhotel Coimbatore, Sheraton New Delhi, ITC Grand Central - Mumbai, ITC Maratha - Mumbai and ITC Rajputana - Jaipur are now certified as the world’s first Twelve LEED Zero Carbon – Certified hotels.













      
        World's First three LEED Zero Water Certified Hotels
      
      
    
















 ITC Mughal Resort & Spa, Agra 










 ITC Sonar, Kolkata 










 ITC Rajputana, Jaipur 







Water is a precious resource and recycling is a responsibility we must uphold to ensure a sustainable future for our planet. ITC Mughal, Agra & ITC Sonar, Kolkata & ITC Rajputana, Jaipur have become the first three ITC hotels to be LEED Zero Water Certified. The certification verifies net zero goals and signals market leadership in the built environment. The hotels have been ensuring that their water requirements are offset by the use of sustainable practices such as recycling water and rainwater harvesting













      
        Key Sustainability Initiatives
      
      
    






















      
        LEED Platinum Certified
      
      
    






ITC Hotels is one of the largest hotel chains in the world to receive the coveted LEED Platinum Certification for all hotels. LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design is amongst the world’s most widely used systems for rating green buildings with platinum being the highest certification.
























      
        Energy Efficiency
      
      
    






Major portion of electrical consumption is met through renewable sources
























      
        Working towards a single use plastic free environment 
      
      
    






Guided by ethos of Responsible Luxury, ITC Hotels is continually striving towards the goal of operating in a single–use-plastic free environment. Towards this we have reduced the usage of single-use-plastic from 150 touch points across hotel operations. This has helped eliminate an estimated 2.5 Lakh Kg plastic per year.
























      
        Sunya Aqua
      
      
    






SunyaAqua - Zero Mile water is treated & purified within the hotel using advanced technology, while conforming to Indian standards for safety and purity.



















				ITC Windsor, Bengaluru
			






      
        Leadership in sustainability
      
      
    






ITC Hotels was named as the 2021 USGBC Regional Leadership Award recipient by the U.S. Green Building Council. This is a global recognition that celebrates organisations around the world who are using green building and sustainable practices to improve the quality of life for those around them.



















				ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad
			






      
        Efficient design & sustainable materials
      
      
    






 The extensive use of natural light within ITC Hotels help in creating comfortable spaces for our guests while lowering electricity consumption. ITC Kohenur, Hyderabad for instance, is aligned in a way that maximises its interaction with the sun, allowing more sunlight into the property throughout the day.

Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes or to fulfil a legal obligation. For instance, requests made by law enforcement agencies, courts or tribunals.
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the agreement that we have entered or may enter into with you, or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure your health and safety). You hereby accept and agree that we shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever if we are unable to perform our services or if there is a deficiency in our services to you due to your failure to provide such information.

You further agree to indemnify and hold us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. harmless from any complaints, legal proceedings or claims filed or initiated by any third party against us in this regard.
We will only use your information for the purposes for [AS2] which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent for providing any additional information to us.
The providers of information are permitted, as and when requested by them, to review the information they had provided.



Confidentiality and Disclosure

The terms of confidentiality and disclosure of personal information will be recorded in the non-disclosure agreement that may be entered into with the provider of the information.
ITC Limited has also adopted reasonable security practices and procedures comprising of managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures with a view to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
ITC Limited uses the personal information only for the purpose for which the same has been furnished.

Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide your information to any other third party.



Transfer of Information

Unless stated otherwise, we store and process your information in India. There will, however, be occasions when we need to transfer your information outside India in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this Policy.
Such transfer of information may be to a country which does or does not provide the same level of data protection as in India. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients to ensure they employ the same or similar appropriate technical and organisational measures as us, so that your information is adequately protected.
Please note that the information that we collect may be transferred to countries which do not have an adequacy of data protection in respect of that country.

Where we know a child is above the age of 16, but considered a minor under applicable law, we will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to collecting or using that child's information. 



Automated decision-making

Withdrawal of Consent
You may at any time revoke or withdraw your consent to provide your information to us by using the applicable contact details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. However, such action may render it impossible for us to assist you any further.  You hereby accept and agree that we shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever if we are unable to perform our services or if there is a deficiency in our services to you due to your withdrawal of consent. You agree that you shall not file or initiate any complaints, legal proceedings or claims against us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. in this regard.

Access
You have the right to know whether we process information about you, and if we do, to access that information we hold about you and to ascertain how we use it and who we share it with.

However, please note that we may retain the information if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so. We will let you know if that is the case.
Please note that after deleting the information, we may not be able to provide the same level of services to you as we will not be aware of your preferences.

Mementos by ITC Hotels is a collection of luxury hotels that offer the rarest of luxuries: 
great memories.
Every detail of the Mementos experience is designed to create exquisite moments, unique to each destination and transform them into something truly unforgettable. So that from the time you arrive, till well after you depart, 
every moment stays with you.




























ONE SMALL STEP FOR YOU,
ONE GIANT LEAP FOR YOUR MEMORIES
The desire to try new things or live the old ones once more. 
To do nothing or everything?
All at the tips of your fingers, and sometimes the toes too.


































THE ART OF CHANGING FOOD INTO MEMORIES
At our collection of restaurants, you’ll have the luxury to relish each dish twice. 
Once when you eat it and
once when you look back on the time you ate it.


































HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SO MOVED
THAT YOU COULDN'T MOVE?
Every experience is crafted to be memorable, and that’s how we’ve briefed our sunsets too. 
But as memories often do, their beauty sometimes surprises us too.



















      
        THE MEMORIES ARE IN THE DETAILS
      
      
    






















      
        MEMENTOS EXPERIENCES
      
      
    






We design every experience to be a warm & memorable one. The well-being programs are designed to rejuvenate & relax, while in-retreat experiences provide a range of activities to indulge in. The F&B experience is exceptional, offering gourmet delights & immersive dining experiences. The city getaways allow you to explore the surrounding areas. All-in-all, every location provides a transformative experience that nourishes your every sense.
























      
        MEMENTOS AMBASSADOR
      
      
    






Mementos Ambassadors are the ultimate memory-makers. With their exceptional skills, they help you create unforgettable experiences across our properties. They ensure that every moment counts, by providing personalized services, guiding you to make the most of your stay and unfolding memories that last a lifetime
























      
        MEMENTOS SIGNATURE SCENT
      
      
    






We’ve bottled memories - this signature scent can be found across our properties. It’s an earthy fragrance that takes you on a journey through nature. With top notes of Sage, Bergamot, and Rosemary, it's as if you're standing in the midst of a lush garden. The heart contains a unique aroma of Cinnamon, adding a sweet & warm touch. This evokes a sense of comfort & indulgence, & a momentary escape down memory lane
























      
        MEMENTOS SONATA
      
      
    






The auditory experience is especially composed for Mementos. A genre of music with the elements of smooth jazz, lounge and Indian instrumentation, making it the perfect background score to your memories. Mementos sonata will soon be available on playlist near you.
























      
        MEMENTOS GUIDE
      
      
    






Discover the city's best experiences with our immersive guidebook. Pick and choose an itinerary that ensures an unforgettable, authentic adventure. Curated tours showcase food, culture, and more. Let our guidebook be your key to uncovering every destination's highlights

Mementos by ITC Hotels Ekaaya - Now Open

From enchanting wildlife safaris, witnessing fine architecture of a 320-year-old temple, immersing in the age-old royal legacies and cultural stories, cruising along the lake in colourful shikaras to relishing the panoramic view of the snow-clad Himalayan peaks or lush coffee estates of Coorg, and plunging into the spectacular infinity pool. There’s also the rush of adrenaline through activities such as rock climbing, turban tying, horse safaris, bird watching, trekking and hiking. The bespoke hospitality and experiences of the Welcomheritage Collection complete your array of unforgettable memories and discoveries of the myriad of cultures and the rich natural heritage of our country.
As an experiential heritage brand, WelcomHeritage hotels’ endeavour is to create a special balance between local traditions and modern-day requirements thus creating best-in-class authentic experience without losing the Heritage ethos in some of the country’s most inspiring settings.

A visual of the competing rate must be provided from the authorized online website/mobile application in order to vet & process the claim
The competing rate must be bookable on an authorized online website/mobile application other than the ITC Hotels website. 
The Best Rate Guarantee shall not be applicable to advertised or enquiry only rates or rates found offline, negotiated corporate rates, group rates, rates requiring membership in a club/ organization or membership of the concerned website/mobile application on which the competing rate is available, direct mail or email solicitations, cash back offers or other rates that are not available to the general public. 
ITC Limited reserves the right to deny a claim if the availability of the Competing Rate cannot be independently verified at the time we process the claim.

Rates that are not immediately bookable. To clarify, certain third party websites do not provide an immediate email confirmation of the booking after completion of the reservation or are confirmed as “on request” or similar status with confirmation sent at a later time.

        New Delhi
      
      
    






It’s rather difficult to slot Delhi - whether Old Delhi or New Delhi - in one particular category. To some it is a “city that never sleeps” dotted with glass-mirrored skyscrapers which house stylishly luxurious offices of multinational companies, to others it’s a metropolis with tree-lined boulevards while to many more it brings back pleasurable memories of bustling streets and bazaars of Chandni Chowk.
The capital city of India, Delhi has also been the principal city for many dynasties and empires over the centuries. Home to communities from all over the country, it is indeed a melting pot of cultures.  
Showcasing delectably different experiences, the city is the perfect example of encapsulation of two very different worlds, the 'old' and the 'new', each representing its own vibrancy and prominence. Take your pick and Delhi, whether old or new or in-between, will never disappoint you.

        Mumbai
      
      
    






Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay, is the capital city of the state of Maharashtra and the financial hub of India. Also home to the country’s famed film industry, the stock exchange and several commercial organisations, it is often known as the ‘city of dreams’, with thousands arriving in each day hoping to make it big.
The name ‘Mumbai’ - derived from Mumbā or Mahā-Ambā is the name of the patron goddess  Mumbadevi of the native Agri, Koli and Somvanshi Kshatriya communities—meaning ""mother"" in the local Marathi language, which is the official language of the state.

The culture of this metro city is a boisterous blend of cuisines, languages, food, fine arts, cinema and festivals. The city-dwellers, often labelled as the 'Mumbaikars', lead a fast-paced life and spend a significant time of their lives commuting from one place to another. Apart from being known as the 'film city of India'. it is one of the biggest metropolitan cities in the country, promising a high-adrenaline, foot-tapping, diverse city life to all its inhabitants.

        Aurangabad
      
      
    






Recently declared the ‘Tourism Capital of Maharashtra’, Aurangabad is an important hub in the state’s tourism sector with its close connection to significant tourist destinations such as caves of Ajanta and Ellora and the famous Mughal monument Bibi-ka-Maqbara, which have been declared ‘World Heritage Sites’ by UNESCO.
Aurangabad, the heritage hub of Maharashtra, is better known as the 'City of Gates' with up to 52 towering Darwazas (Gates), majority of which were constructed by Aurangzeb during his over-stay in the Deccan. There are four main Darwazas leading into the city, which along with nine secondary darwazas formed part of the defence systems of the city.
Although Marathi and Urdu are the principal languages of the city, they are spoken in Dakhni – Hyderabadi Urdu dialect. Wali Dakhni, the first established poet to have composed a classical poem in Urdu was from Aurangabad. Other prominent poets from Aurangabad include Siraj Aurangabadi, Azad Bilgrami and Sikandar Ali Wajd. With a variety of cuisine and travel spots to choose from, Aurangabad is a city that welcomes people from around the globe to explore and discover the glorious past related to the city.

        Visakhapatnam
      
      
    






Visakhapatnam, or Vizag as it is often called, is one of the best tourism destinations in Andhra Pradesh. From lakes to cool beaches, from beautiful hill ranges to caves and valleys, Visakhapatnam has them all. The district has many tourism spots that represent the culture and heritage of India – be it The Araku Valley or the Kailasa Giri, that is packed with beauty of green meadows and parks; even the Borra Caves show the magnificence of colours in natural cave formations.
Visakhapatnam, a city of cultural & religious diversity is credited of having the oldest shipyard in India, housing a natural harbour besides being the headquarters of the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy.

With a rich cultural past, strategic location and picturesque landscape, Vizag is the perfect destination to keep one’s spirits soaring. The city sometimes goes by its now mostly extinct colonial British name, Waltair or the 'City of Destiny'.

Home to several state-owned heavy industries, Visakhapatnam owns one of the most advanced steel plants and also showcases one of the country's largest ports and oldest shipyard.

        Vadodara
      
      
    






Vadodara, a quondam princely state on the banks of the River Vishwamitiri, is an amalgam of old world charm and modern prosperity. Popularly known as Baroda, , it houses grand old palaces and temples with swanky IT parks and corporate offices, Vadodara is also acknowledged as the cultural capital of Gujarat.
An important industrial, educational and cultural hub of western India, the city exhibits several institutions of national and regional importance. While its major industries include petrochemicals, engineering, pharmaceuticals, plastics, IT and foreign exchange services, Vadodara also has some interesting city sights like Aurobindo ashram, Nazarbaugh palace, Maharaja Fateh Singh Museum, Tambekar wada, etc, but the main reason for coming here is the stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site of Champaner and Pavagadh. Amongst numerous other irresistible attractions dotting this fabulous city, is the famous Pavagadh Kalika Mandir and the priceless art collection at the Fateh Singh Museum and Laxmi Vilas Palace.

Sitting at the edge of the majestic Yamuna River, Agra was once the glorious capital of the mighty Mughal Empire at the peak of its power. However, in today’s world, Agra is synonymous with one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal.  It is a major tourist destination because of its many splendid Mughal-era buildings, most notably the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur. The legacy of the Mughal Empire has left a magnificent fort and a liberal sprinkling of fascinating tombs and mausoleums; and there’s also fun to be had in the bustling bazars (marketplaces). The examples of art and culture in this historic city are not only breathtaking but are also mirrors of the artistic talents of the Indian population during the grand past. 
The city has its unique style of traditional paintings, folk dances, folk music and embroideries. Agra is also a popular shopping destination where you can buy marble with inlay work, semi-precious stones, jewellery and handicrafts. The city is also very famous for its superior quality leather goods like bags, belts and jackets.

        Goa
      
      
    






Splashed by the waters of the Arabian Sea on the Konkan coast, Goa is the smallest state in India by area and the fourth smallest by population. It was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years, beginning with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. Its culture has evolved as a colourful blend of Portuguese and Konkan influences. The architecture and décor of its Portuguese mansions have still been preserved at various places, especially in Fontainhas, the old Latin Quarter in Panjim, Goa’s capital.
Goa has attracted tourists from all over India and across the world, much loved for its easy-going lifestyle and hospitable people. The concept of ‘sussegad’ is believed to define the prevailing mood in Goa – a relaxed, laid-back approach to life that happily denies entry to the very idea of stress or strain. The beaches are amongst the finest in India, with clean sands and mostly gentle breakers.

The imposing churches of old Goa are a fascinating repository of its colonial past, while its famed night life, bars, restaurants, beach shacks and flea markets are entirely contemporary.

It was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years, beginning with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. Its culture has evolved as a colourful blend of Portuguese and Konkan influences.

        Port Blair
      
      
    






Find yourself amidst the swaying palms and the sea breeze in Port Blair. The capital city sits on one of the 37 inhabited islands of the 572 that make up the stunning union territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Situated just a few hours away from the mainland, the islands open up a portal to a different world. From historical sites to a diverse and lush flora and fauna, this site once known for the infamous Kalapani - a British era prison used to house freedom fighters and political prisoners, is home to a rich blend of history, culture, and adventure.

        Pahalgam
      
      
    






A gilded version of a mountainside manor where every season brings with itself something new; the valley, it seems changes colours as winters fade into spring and summers blend with Autumn. Pahalgam is an ideal destination to put your feet up, snuggle into a comfy couch, and sip cup after cup of Kahwa. While you are at it, watch the snow etch a pattern on your window. Pahalgam is also a trekker’s delight, serving as the base for several treks that cut through the mountains and scamper alongside the river. For adrenaline junkies, river rafting is a viable option. For those looking to relax, golf at the Pahalgam Golf Course and fishing at the river will clinch the deal.

In such cases, ITC Limited may choose not to provide any services/supply goods for which the information was necessary.
While collecting information, ITC Limited or any entity authorized on its behalf to collect information takes such steps as are, in the circumstances, reasonable to ensure that the person providing the information has the knowledge of -


the fact that the information is being collected
the purpose for which the information is being collected; and
the intended recipients of the information


Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else's interests)
Where it is needed in the public interest or for official purposes or to fulfil a legal obligation. For instance, requests made by law enforcement agencies, courts or tribunals.
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the agreement that we have entered or may enter into with you, or we may be prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure your health and safety). You hereby accept and agree that we shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever if we are unable to perform our services or if there is a deficiency in our services to you due to your failure to provide such information. You agree that you shall not file or initiate any complaints, legal proceedings or claims against us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. in this regard. You further agree to indemnify and hold us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. harmless from any complaints, legal proceedings or claims filed or initiated by any third party against us in this regard.
We will only use your information for the purposes for [AS2] which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
You agree that we do not need any additional or further consent from you to use your sensitive personal information in accordance with this Policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights.
In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to collect and process certain additional sensitive personal information. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent for providing any additional information to us.
The providers of information are permitted, as and when requested by them, to review the information they had provided.



Confidentiality and Disclosure

The terms of confidentiality and disclosure of personal information will be recorded in the non-disclosure agreement that may be entered into with the provider of the information.
ITC Limited has also adopted reasonable security practices and procedures comprising of managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures with a view to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized disclosure of personal information.
ITC Limited uses the personal information only for the purpose for which the same has been furnished. ITC Limited does not retain information after the purpose for which it is furnished is accomplished unless the same is required to be retained under any law in force or for audit purposes. In such cases also, confidentiality of such information is maintained.
We may disclose your information to any of our employees, officers, insurers, professional advisers, agents, suppliers or subcontractors insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy and for the purpose of providing services to you. We may disclose your information to any member of our organisation including our subsidiaries and partners, insofar as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Policy. We may disclose your information: 
to the extent that we are required to do so by law; 
in connection with any ongoing or prospective legal proceedings; 
in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights including providing information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk; 
to the purchaser or prospective purchaser of any business or asset that we are or are contemplating selling; and 
to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that information where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that information. 


Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, we will not provide your information to any other third party.



Transfer of Information

Unless stated otherwise, we store and process your information in India. There will, however, be occasions when we need to transfer your information outside India in order to enable us to use the information in accordance with this Policy.
Such transfer of information may be to a country which does or does not provide the same level of data protection as in India. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your information is adequately protected. Typically, such steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients to ensure they employ the same or similar appropriate technical and organisational measures as us, so that your information is adequately protected.
Please note that the information that we collect may be transferred to countries which do not have an adequacy of data protection in respect of that country. This means that the country to which we transfer your information is not deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for your information. To ensure that your information does receive an adequate level of protection we have put in place strong inter country security measures to ensure that your information is treated by those third parties in a way that is consistent with the nation in which you reside.
You expressly agree to the transfers of your information described in this Section.



Information about Children

As a general rule, we do not intentionally collect information about children under the age of 16. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information about children under the age of 16, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible, except where we are required by applicable law to keep it.
Where we know a child is above the age of 16, but considered a minor under applicable law, we will obtain parental/guardian consent prior to collecting or using that child's information. 



Automated decision-making

Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention.
We do not envisage that any decisions will be taken about you using automated means. However, we will notify you in writing if this position changes.



Policy for Website and Mobile Application Usage

Any personal information shared by you in our website and mobile application shall be kept confidential in accordance with ITC Limited's reasonable security practices and procedures. Personal information, shared by you, shall be used for doing the intended business with you.

The information inside the log files includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks made by you.

You may choose to share certain special categories of personal data, such as health, with us directly (or through authorised persons, travel agents, etc.) in certain circumstances. We collect such special categories of personal data only when it is essential. Examples of where we may collect and process sensitive personal information includes the following: 
where you have requested specific medical assistance from us, such as the provision of a wheelchair, medical assistance; or
where such information has been passed onto us by a third party, where you have given that third party consent to do so, such as the travel agent through which you made your booking or from other hotels for your onward journey, where the processing of such special categories of personal data is required for the processing of your service request.


By providing such special category of personal data you agree that we may collect, use and share this information with third parties for the purpose of processing your service request, as described in this Privacy Policy[AS3] .
ITC Limited shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for any violation or misuse of your personal information by unauthorised persons consequent to misuse of the internet environment.



Accuracy of Information 
It is important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please keep us informed if your information changes during your relationship with us.


Access and Correction of Information

If any information we have about you is not accessible through our website/mobile application, you can send us a request for access to this information at no cost using the applicable contact details set out at the end of this Policy.
After receiving your request and sufficient information to verify your identity we will provide you with a copy of the information we have about you which you are entitled to have under applicable law. We will also confirm the purposes for which such information is being used, its recipients and the origin of the information.
You may write to us at any time requesting amendments to certain information that you consider to be incorrect or irrelevant or to request that we block, erase or otherwise remove your information. We will update, block, erase or remove your information upon request in line with applicable law.



Deletion of Information
You may at any time ask us to delete your information.  We will consider and where necessary comply with your request in accordance with applicable law, as explained above. Please note that after deleting the information, we may not be able to provide the same level of services to you as we will not be aware of your preferences.


Withdrawal of Consent
You may at any time revoke or withdraw your consent to provide your information to us by using the applicable contact details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy. However, such action may render it impossible for us to assist you any further.  You hereby accept and agree that we shall not be held liable in any manner whatsoever if we are unable to perform our services or if there is a deficiency in our services to you due to your withdrawal of consent. You agree that you shall not file or initiate any complaints, legal proceedings or claims against us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. in this regard. You further agree to indemnify and hold us and/or our employees, directors, associates, etc. harmless from any complaints, legal proceedings or claims filed or initiated by any third party against us in this regard


Access
You have the right to know whether we process information about you, and if we do, to access that information we hold about you and to ascertain how we use it and who we share it with. Please note that we may not provide you with certain information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the information we hold about you would reveal information about another person) or where another exemption applies. 


Portability 

You have the right to receive a subset of information we collect from you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such information to another party. If you wish for us to transfer the information to another party, please ensure you provide details of that party and note that we can only do so where it is legally, contractually and technically feasible.
We are not responsible for the security of the information, its transmission or its processing once received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain information if providing it would interfere with another’s rights (e.g. where providing the information we hold about you would reveal information about another person). 



Erasure 

You may request that we erase the information we hold about you in the following circumstances:
 you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the information we hold about you;
we are processing the information we hold about you on the basis of your consent and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no other ground under which we can process the information;
we are processing the information we hold about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing;
you no longer wish us to use the information we hold about you in order to send you promotions, special offers, marketing and lucky draws; or
you believe the information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.
However, please note that we may retain the information if there are valid grounds under law for us to do so. We will let you know if that is the case.
Please note that after deleting the information, we may not be able to provide the same level of services to you as we will not be aware of your preferences. Where you have requested that we erase information that we have made public and there are grounds for erasure, we will use reasonable steps to attempt to tell others that are displaying the information or providing links to the information to erase such information.

 


Restrict Processing of your Information
In certain circumstances, you have a right to ask us to stop processing your information other than for storage purposes. However, please note that even if we stop processing your information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under applicable laws for us to do so (e.g. for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection).
You may ask us to stop processing your information and just store it with us in the following cases:

 Where your information is not accurate. In such a case you can ask us to stop processing your information for the duration it takes us to verify whether the information is accurate;


Where we wish to erase your information as the processing we are doing is unlawful but you want us to store the information instead;
Where we wish to erase the information as it is no longer necessary for our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or
Where you have objected to our processing of your information on the basis of our legitimate interest and during the duration it takes us to determine whether there is an overriding interest for us to retain such information.



Objection 

You have the right to object to our processing of your information which is used to send you promotions, special offers, marketing messages, including where we build profiles for such purposes.
You may also object to the processing of your information (including where the processing is profiling) on the basis of our legitimate interest and your objection to such processing

Enabling authentic indigenous experiences in harmony with environment & society 





Each ITC Hotel is an archetype of the culture and ethos of the region that it is located in. The concept of each of the hotels weaves in the strongest elements of the culture of the region – harking back through architecture, interiors, art and artefacts to the major dynasties who have ruled India.
The unique value propositions, including the differentiated character of hotels, coupled with indigenous experiences is what makes every ITC Hotel unique.

India’s centuries-rooted sacred relationship with its environment, of sustenance and nurture, is a vital and living heritage that is the cornerstone of the ITC Hotels ethos and an affirmation of Responsible Luxury: luxury without compromising the earth and sustainability without compromising luxury. 

Responsible Luxury is the effective combination of luxury and responsible practices (enriching society and the environment) so that the luxury experiences delivered at ITC Hotels do not in any way burden the environment or the society around us. In fact, it is aimed at creating a positive impact on both the community-at-large and the environment.

It ensures that sustainable practices are built into our hotels in the design phase itself, thus enabling ITC Hotels to be eco-embedded, services to be eco-easy and our associates to be eco-sensitised; all of this while ensuring you indulge guilt-free. All ITC Hotels are LEED Platinum certified.

        Other Initiatives
      
      
    






Empowering Differently-abled people
 ITC Hotels has established that if provided with an opportunity to work and become self-sufficient, people who are differently-abled can significantly contribute to the workplace, families and the community. ITC Hotels has taken a positive step in this direction by employing people who are differently-abled across its hotels. ITC Hotels believes that everyone should be treated with sensitivity and empathy. The models it has created have been effective and have succeeded in sensitising other employees to the needs of those differently-abled. Keeping in mind their specific skills, many differently abled have been employed in diverse functions like housekeeping, teleworking, bakery and as musicians. Special badges for the visually impaired, whistles for hearing impaired employees to communicate in an emergency and sign language classes for the staff to communicate with them are just a few examples of how ITC Hotels has created an atmosphere of sensitivity and caring.
ITC Hotels has also published a booklet aimed at sharing experiences with the rest of the corporate world and laying down a step-by-step guide to demystify the perceived complexities around employing persons with disabilities. 
WelcomTheatre
WelcomTheatre showcases the best of Indian theatre productions, especially at the experimental stage. Acknowledging theatre and art as integral to a country's culture and tradition, ITC Hotels offers Quality entertainment & theatrical experiences through WelcomTheatre.
ITC Hotels is dedicated to the cause of nurturing art in India through its WelcomArt forum. While each hotel has its own vast collection of art and art objects, the group decided to brand all art activities, under the banner WelcomArt.
