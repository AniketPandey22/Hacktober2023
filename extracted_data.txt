It is important to show respect and appreciation for the rich traditions and customs of the Balinese people. This includes being mindful of their religious practices, dressing modestly when visiting temples, and seeking permission before taking photographs of individuals or sacred sites. Offerings are an integral part of Balinese daily life and are considered sacred. It is important to walk around them or step over them carefully to avoid causing any rudeness or offense. Additionally, it is advisable to avoid touching or disturbing the offerings in any way, as they hold great significance to the Balinese people. Touching someone's head is considered disrespectful in Balinese culture. The head is believed to be the most sacred part of the body, and touching it without permission is seen as intrusive. It is important to show respect by refraining from any physical contact with someone's head, even if it may seem like a friendly gesture in other cultures. In Bali, entering temples without proper attire is considered unmannered. Temples are sacred places and it is important to dress modestly and respectfully when visiting them. This typically means covering your shoulders, wearing a sarong or a long skirt, and sometimes even wearing a sash. By following these guidelines, you show respect for the religious beliefs and customs of the Balinese people. This is because Mount Batur is an active volcano and can be dangerous to climb without proper guidance. Hiring a guide ensures your safety and also supports the local economy as many guides are locals who rely on tourism for their livelihood. Additionally, the guides are knowledgeable about the mountain's history and cultural significance and can enhance your overall experience by providing valuable insights during the climb. Drinking tap water can pose health risks due to potential contaminants or impurities. Opting for bottled water ensures a safer and more reliable source of hydration, especially in unfamiliar locations where water quality may vary. Public displays of affection can vary greatly in acceptability across different cultures. In some places, excessive displays of affection may be seen as inappropriate or offensive. It is important to be mindful of local customs and norms to avoid unintentionally causing discomfort or offense to others. Feeding monkeys in monkey forests can disrupt their natural behaviour and diet, leading to negative consequences for their health and well-being. Additionally, feeding them can also pose risks to human safety as they may become aggressive or dependent on human food. It is best to observe and appreciate these animals from a distance, respecting their natural habitat and allowing them to thrive in their own environment. Driving without an international driver's license can result in legal consequences, such as fines or even imprisonment, depending on the country. It is important to obtain the proper documentation before operating a vehicle in a foreign country to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Don't imply criticism or disrespect towards Indonesian leaders or religious figures in public conversations or social media posts about your stay in Bali.

While it's known for its lush environment and gorgeous islands that sparkle on bright, sunny days, it also has a monsoon season and occasionally scorching temperatures, so picking the correct time to visit is crucial. Between November to early April, the cold and dry season, when temperatures vary from 84°F to 97°F, is the ideal time to take up a Thailand travel package. However, because the climate changes around the country, it makes it an all year around destination. The best time for good weather. The monsoons are followed by a mild and dry season, therefore the terrain is lush and the climate is favourable. The beautiful weather, on the other hand, means Thailand is at its busiest. People and inflated rates abound throughout Christmas and the western New Year holidays. When the monsoon is either just settling in or just departing, and the weather is not too high, the two shoulder season periods are ideal times to visit Thailand with a Thailand tour package from India. The months of April to June are often hot and dry, with an average temperature of 30°C in Bangkok. Sea breezes, on the other hand, provide natural air conditioning in coastal locations. The Gulf Coast Islands are your perfect idea for escaping weather in September and October. The shoulder season is also an ideal time to go surfing or diving on the west coast of Thailand.

If you go during the off-season, be flexible with your travel arrangements. Booking a cheap thailand tour package with airfare is possible due to the low season by the monsoons.

Vietnamese is the most spoken language in Vietnam. French is the most spoken foreign language in Vietnam owing to a legacy of colonial rule. Russian, Czech, German, and Polish are other languages spoken in small sections in Vietnam. Vietnamese Dong (VND) is the most commonly used currency in Vietnam. However big shops and hotels accept US dollars as well, so if you bring some US dollars, they can come handy. The ideal time is anywhere between 5 - 10 days. For a short stay, you can take up a Vietnam tour package for 3 days or a Vietnam itinerary for 4 days. If you have a few extra days at hand, you can go for a Vietnam itinerary for 5 days.

Vietnam's transport network is pretty well connected making the option of domestic flights for long-distance travel the most convenient. Vietnam also has boats, buses, minibus, & taxi services that makes it easy for commuting throughout the country. Also the cost of travelling in Vietnam is very affordable making it possible to explore the entire country at one stretch. Vietnam is considered as a safe country to visit for tourists. But unfortunately, pick pocketing is a risk at major tourists spots in Hanoi & Ho Chi Minh City which finds crowd in plenty and therefore its advised to take precautions. Valuable items like passport, money and mobile phones are most safe when kept in a waist belt or pouch that hangs around the neck or best left locked up in your hotel safe. Don't jaywalk, don't take a photo of Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, don't go for a traditional taxi, choose Uber/Grab instead, don't buy without bargaining - try out your haggling skills, don't leave your belongings unattended as robbery is very common in Vietnam. In major cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, credit cards are accepted in upmarket establishments intended for tourists. High end restaurants also accept credit cards. But credit cards are likely to attract a surcharge of 5% or more. Therefore it is advisable to carry cash while travelling out of major Vietnam cities. The bigger cities like Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi face huge traffic jams. It gets rather difficult to ride solo on a motorbike in these cities and hence is advised to drive safely keeping in consideration the road conditions. But in less crowded cities, commuting on a motorbike is the most convenient mode of transport. Vietnam has numerous beaches that range from long stretches of coastline to hidden coves. The most famous beaches include Nha Trang which is renowned for its offshore islands and diving sites, Con Dao islands are the best for a quiet getaway & Phu Quoc is well-known for its white sandy beaches.

One of the essential aspects of planning your Australia trip is understanding the Australia tour from India cost. The average cost of an Australia trip ranges from Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 3,00,00.  The total cost of your trip can vary significantly based on factors such as your travel style, duration, and preferences. Here's a breakdown of the key expenses to consider: Airfare Costs: Your trip to Australia cost is huge. Prices can fluctuate throughout the year, so it's advisable to book well in advance to secure the best deals. Accommodation Expenses: Accommodation costs vary based on your choice of hotels, hostels, or vacation rentals. You can find options to suit every budget, from luxury hotels in major cities to budget-friendly hostels. Daily Expenses: These include food, local transportation, activities, and shopping. Australia offers a wide range of dining options, from affordable street food to gourmet restaurants. Budget vs. Luxury Travel: Your overall Australia tour packages from India price will be significantly influenced by your choice of accommodations, dining, and activities. Budget travellers can keep costs down by opting for economical options, while luxury travellers can indulge in upscale experiences. Reaching Australia from India involves a long-haul flight, and there are several options to consider: Flight Options: Indian cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai offer direct flights to major Australian cities like Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane. Airlines like Air India, Qantas, Emirates, and Singapore Airlines operate these routes. Connecting Airports: If you don't have a direct flight from your departure city, you may need to make a connecting flight through hubs like Singapore, Dubai, or Kuala Lumpur. Travel Time: The flight duration from India to Australia varies depending on your departure city and destination in Australia. On average, it takes approximately 12-14 hours to reach major Australian cities from India. It's advisable to book your flights well in advance to secure the best prices and travel dates. Additionally, consider factors like layover times and airport facilities when planning your journey. Australia's vast size and diverse climate make it a year-round destination, but the best time to visit varies depending on your interests and the regions you plan to explore. Seasonal Overview: Australia experiences four seasons: summer (December to February), autumn (March to May), winter (June to August), and spring (September to November). Peak vs. Off-Peak Seasons: The peak tourist season in Australia is during the Southern Hemisphere summer (December to February). This is when the weather is warmest, and many tourists flock to popular destinations. Off-peak seasons offer more budget-friendly travel options and smaller crowds. Weather Considerations: The best time to visit specific regions depends on the weather.

Carry sunscreen lotion, an umbrella for the sun and a hat as the weather here is hot and sunny most of the time. Pack light wear clothes and beach wear because the weather here is warm and sunny. If you wish to have personalised experiences such as decorated rooms in the resort then it can be requested to the staff. Do not miss participating in thrilling water sports activities in Mauritius. There are various activities specially designed for couples which will give you wonderful memories. Check the weather forecast before going out because Mauritius is mostly warm, humid and sunny.

Who doesn't love to spend quality time with family? Especially when you don't get the spell on normal days, you must plan family holidays to see that excitement on your kid's face. But going to a whole new place without any research can lead you to face unwanted consequences. That's why we are here to help you with some pro tips that you must keep in mind- no matter which family summer vacation ideas you are working on! So without wasting another minute, let's check it out. If you are visiting with kids or older persons, make sure the trip becomes comfortable enough for them. Starting from car seats to activities, personalize everything accordingly. Ultimately all of you want to enjoy it together. So, if any of you get sick or feel uncomfortable, the whole trip will be spoiled. So, whatever you do, think and do it wisely. Another thing you need to ensure is everything is planned beforehand and picture-perfect. Nowadays, everything can be done online- from accommodation to your whole itinerary. Even, it can save on your budget as well besides helping you to avoid all those extra hassles. You must select the place of lodging very carefully. From food to your rooms, everything should be hygienic enough that any of you don't fall sick. Alongside, if you're travelling to a hill station, check which height is comfortable for breathing. Especially for children and elderly people, staying at too much height can cause breathing problems. For any emergency situation, you must have the precautions to overcome it. Carry a first aid kit on your family holidays. Also, if you are travelling with a diabetic patient or with anyone who has some chronic disease like this, make sure the regular medication is within your reach while travelling. Any place, which represents nature's beauty, looks at it's best, at specific seasons. For instance, the month of October is the best time to visit Bali. A little rain, low humidity and full of Sun let you chill through the day without even getting tired. So researching the best season to visit your desired destination is a must-do job. Be safe throughout your journey. Travelling with family comes with a number of responsibilities and a few dos and don'ts. Book exciting summer vacation packages for family and fly out to spend your family holidays.

Nowadays everything and everyone is highly connected to the internet. So booking everything online, from accommodation to tours beforehand is much cheaper. Also, it helps you in avoiding all the hassles that you might face during your trip for booking a hotel or renting a bike. It is not possible to rely on drivers to get you everywhere you need to, and also it is comparatively costly. So it is better to rent a scooter and travel freely wherever you want to. There are a few debit cards that charge foreign transaction fees, so every time you make a payment it will cost you an additional amount. So it is advisable to use cash for making payments. This might sound weird but it is good to carry a water bottle along with you. The bottled water is not so expensive but it is better to avoid using plastic and save the environment. Go green! There are tons of restaurants to cater to the needs of the tourists, but the prices are very high compared to the food in the local market. In the local market, you can enjoy mouth-watering food at a very low price. Also, you get to know about their local culture. So are you excited for the trip? Pickyoutrail is there to help you to plan your vacation on a budget. We have exciting budget tour packages that you just can’t resist. So pack your bags and get ready for one of the most memorable budget holidays of your life.

Hello Guest, BENCHMARK FORCUSTOMER DELIGHT 4.8Based on the opinions of 1000+ people on Facebook Maldives Trip - It was a great trip because of your support. Specially Ms. Vartika\nThank you so much for helping us. Dear Pick Your Trail team,\n\nI want to express my sincere gratitude for an incredible Dubai trip arranged by your team. The experience of skydiving and edge walking was truly exhilarating and a once-in-a-lifetime adventure. I appreciate how Pick Your Trail not only fulfilled my wish list but also provided exceptional service. Everything was well-organized, on time, and the 24/7 support was invaluable when needed. Dubai's cleanliness and the uniqueness of its offerings make it a must-visit destination. Thank you for making my Dubai experience memorable.\n\nBest regards,\nJay valangar We had a lovely trip in Bali with the help of Pick your trail. All the arrangements were flawless. The guide cum drivers were really friendly accommodative and helpful. Everything was as planned. Our entire trip right from landing in Bali till we got back to India was just flawless. All thanks to Pick Your Trail ! Thank You PYT team for organising our Dubai trip in the month of December..  PYT team helped us and made alternate arrangements for flights without impacting our itenary becauze of disruptions due to cyclone.. we were able to access them throughout the trip and we got  quick response for all our queries.\nEntire itenrary went as per plan and no deviation or delays and no last minute suprises . Kudos to the team for giving as a relaxed trip.. 👍👍 Smooth experience starting from making a decision to choose the right resort in maldives ! and the price was very reasonable! hassle free experience! We booked our Singapore trip with pick your trail . It was amazing. We were travelling with 3 senior citizens . Everything was planned according to them . Thanks for perfect itenary Mr.Abdul .  From planning to execution they were easily reachable. Overall the trip was a memorable one. Thank you team. We had an exceptional experience during our recent Thailand tour with Pickyourtrail. From the moment we booked our package to the final farewell, every aspect of the journey was as per our expectations.\nPickyourtrail team was available for support throughout the whole planning phase.\nThe itinerary was thoughtfully curated, allowing us to explore the places without feeling rushed.The selection of accommodations was superb.\nOne aspect that stood out to us was the seamless coordination of logistics throughout the tour. From airport transfers to transportation between destinations and timely departures for scheduled activities, everything ran like clockwork. This allowed us to relax and completely enjoy the tour. Fantastic arrangements made by Pick Your Trail, from bringing us up at the airport to allowing us to explore for five days. I must add that the trip was smooth and hassle-free for both of us. Highly recommended for those wishing to make a reservation through them. Clarity on changes with drivers is the only thing we would suggest. For our calm journey, it would be great if there were sufficient clarification and information regarding the driver for our next day's travel. 24/7 chat support service was too good.

Our fees range between Rs. 1000 - Rs. 5000 per person depending on the complexity of the itinerary and duration. For instance,in a few countries in Europe and Asia, the municipal taxes (charged by the mayor of the city) will need to be paid during check-out. This is not included. They range between Rs. 50 - Rs. 100 per person per night. Raison d'Être. That's why we built the product. Go ahead, and click on Changebutton next to hotels, flights, trains, transfer modes and voila you can change them then and there. We believe we have most used cases covered, let us know if there is something else that we could add to make your experience awesome-er. Drop us a line at idea@pickyourtrail.com. Ahh, looks like we have an involved traveler. Fret not. We have you covered. Do you spot the edit option next to the cities? Click on it. You would be surprised by what a click of button can do! You can change,replace or add a city :) Your wish is our command! Look out for our pencil icon  as you hover over days, and click on it to add / remove days to your heart’s content. Yes, you can! SmartPhones are amazing and we love them too. So go ahead, click on the enable editing button, and change to your hearts content. By the way, you can also get a real time cost on mobile! Bingo, do you see the  button? Hit that, fill in your email, and voila! Your quote has reached your inbox! Share it with your fiance, family and let us know if there is something that we can do to help you book :) Click on room details under the hotel listed. You will be able to view the room that is pre-selected. To change the room click on Change room option which pops up on clicking room details. Easy-peasy! Shucks. That’s bad. Maybe you are indeed one in a million. Fret not, you should be able to drop us a postcard from your product. If not - go ahead and send a mail to planners@pickyourtrail.com and we will reach out to you! You can easily change your mode of transfer by clicking on the pencil icon  between cities. You can swap between train, air and other available modes of transport. Woah, you got us there. This is a rare case. Why don’t you drop us an email or chat with us to let us know? We will add that in a jiffy for you! And, by the way - you get a 10% discount on that activity. Finders keepers and all, you know! :) We try and slot activities in the best possible time slot. We take into consideration facts like the historical queue length, if it’s a view-point, what the best time to be there is, type of activity and other parameters. If you still want to go ahead and change the activity you can do so by removing it first from that time slot, and adding it in your desired time-slot. We are glad you asked! There is a child-friendly filter on activities, too. We recommend you use it to find the relevant, best possible activities for him / her. It’s a mix of both online and our customers’ reviews of hotels. The idea is to help you narrow down on a hotel of your choice quickly. While you are at it, go ahead and toggle with the breakfast and free wifi filters. Keep your passport copies handy. Kindly ensure that you type in the names only as per passport. In case you don’t have a last name on your passport, kindly give us a call. We encourage you to understand all visa requirements as it’s one of the most time consuming processes. For a quick summary, visit our page -visa.pickyourtrail.com. Do ensure that you have also cross checked against the embassy website as we all know how governments can change decisions overnight! :) Your passport needs to have a validity of 6 months from the date of arrival back into the country. There should have not been any observations made on your passport. Yes, you can freeze the cost by paying 50% of the overall trip cost as booking confirmation fee. Depending on the country you are visiting, you may or may not need flight and hotel vouchers for your visa application. Yes, we will assist you with your visa documentation for a fee. This is to ensure that your documentation is done right and you have got all the proofs required. Do keep in mind that the issuance of visa is solely based on the visa assessing officer! We cannot guarantee visa issuance. In the last 1000+ trails, only 6 customers have been denied a visa. Once you have made the payment, you will receive a payment confirmation. Our backend technology will initiate the booking process and we will keep you posted. You will then receive a status email of all your bookings within 24 hours. The cancellation policy for flights, hotels, trains and car rental is as per their cancellation policy. For activities and transfers, the payment is non-refundable if it is under 21 days of departure. Our service charges are non-refundable. Cancellation of any activities is based on the cancellation policy stated on the voucher. If it is feasible and there is availability in the new activity that you want, you can go ahead and change the same. This is the rarest of rare case. This generally happens when multiple travellers are looking at the same room. Given we cannot block rooms and air tickets, there are chances that your prices may have changed after you booked. In such cases, we will intimate you as soon as we come to know of it and also ensure that we provide you suitable options. You would need to write us an email as we will have to speak to all our partners to give you a consolidated cancellation amount. It will take anywhere between 48-72 hours for the same. You can reach out to us on the dedicated support platform. We are available from 7am IST to 10pm IST. In times when we are not available you will be able to reach either or local partners or the direct activity provider mentioned in the email. This is a rare event at Pickyourtrail, as we only work with top 5 partners in every destination. If sudden changes in weather or other such unforeseen events lead to cancellation, you will be refunded the amount for the experience as per the cancellation policy of the experience provider. Also, if there is sufficient heads up, we try and give you an equally exciting option, based on your interests. Our normal refund policy is 15 working days from the date of the cancelled activity or any other inclusion. In case there's a delay beyond this time, the team will keep the customer informed. It is always best to get in touch with the airline people directly to get a quick solution. You can also reach out to us through the support group or call the emergency number listed in the support group. You can either lodge a police complaint or call up the embassy to figure out a better solution. Travel Troops Global Private Ltd.© 2024 all rights reserved. We think you are in .

Thailand is a well-known Asian country located in the Indochinese peninsula. It is a major tourist attraction with its numerous beautiful beaches, Buddhist temples, and royal mansions displaying the country’s rich history. The capital, Bangkok, remains the most visited city earning the “World’s Best City” recognition for 4 years in a row. Along with their involvement in the ASEAN, the country has amazing beach resorts in cities like Pattaya and Patong. Certainly, Thailand is a name you’re certain to find on every traveler’s wishlist, boasting a range of stunning beaches and historic temples leaving travelers in awe of the country. Being a shopping paradise, the country is famous for its busy streets and happening nightlife. One just cannot get enough of the scenic destinations it brings to the table. Thailand Tour Packages amplifies the allure of this popular haven for tourists worldwide, offering curated experiences that encompass the beauty of its beaches, the serenity of its temples, and the vibrant energy of its bustling streets and nightlife. A prominent part of Southeast Asia located in the middle of the Indochinese Peninsula, Thailand is a country of over 70 million people spanning a cumulated area of over 513,120 square kilometers. Characterized by a subtropical climate, Thailand can be described as a hot and humid country with December being the coldest month of the year. Bangkok, the capital city witnesses millions of tourists each year. Thailand is a Buddhist-dominated land with around 95% of them being Buddhist while Islam, Hinduism, and Sikhism constitute the remainder. During their Thailand trip, one is sure to come across numerous Buddhist temples and monasteries representing rich Buddhist heritage. The present culture of Thailand is a mix of Buddhist traditions with Westernization that plays a massive role in shaping the modern culture of the country. Thailand is indeed the epitome of charm and introduces tourists to some splendid destinations for a memorable vacation. The country is home to the city of Phuket which is the largest island of Thailand having a name for its vibrant nightlife and mesmerizing beaches. To complete your journey across the waterways, the city of Pattaya takes care of all your beachy temptations.  The capital city of Bangkok is well known for its notable Buddhist temples and its innumerable options for shopping. Another addition to the list is the city of Ko Yao Noi which is a land of fishing villages and rubber plantations. People interested in the country’s history will have a great time exploring the cities of Ayutthaya, Kanchanaburi, and Chiang Rai. Thailand serves well to satisfy every travel craving of tourists, providing exciting activities like boat rides, sightseeing, snorkeling, surfing, and much more. At Pattaya, travelers can try adventurous acts like flyboarding at Koh Samui Chaweng Beach and snorkeling at Koh Rin Island. The city of Phuket opens doors for surfing at its serene beaches and scuba diving in the Andaman Sea before you return to your luxury resort to relish a rejuvenating spa session. Krabi is another destination that cannot be missed from the list, providing opportunities for boat tours and kayaking in its alluring rivers. The modes of transport in Thailand include buses, tuk-tuks, taxis, trains and rentals. Although metro and train commutes are available, buses, from air-conditioned buses to minibusses, are inexpensive and widespread. Tuk-tuks are the locally preferred means of traveling, accounting for the famous Bangkok traffic. There are also trolleybuses, great for city tours, that are present all over the country. Taxi service in Thailand is, to put it simply, colorful. Unless it is a metered taxi, taxis are not as preferred as, say, motorbike taxis or tuk-tuks, because of the scams that drivers pull. Although taxis are readily available from major tourist spots, it is better to pre-book a taxi from the airport and back to ensure fair fares. Tuk-tuks are uniquely Thailand-based but they, and motorbike taxis, are not as convenient as taxis. Free passes are not available for city tours or transportation but the train and bus ticket fares are feasible. With an extraordinary traffic scenario, the best way to get around Thailand is by renting cars, bikes, or scooters. Having the freedom to explore the land at your own pace is made easy with rental agencies like Expert, Hertz, Bangkok Scooter Rental, Big Bike Rental Bangkok, and Go Bangkok Tours. The fares may differ but the option to hire a chauffeur to drive you around in the rented vehicle should make the deal better. Thailand is known as the ‘Land of Smiles’ because of its extremely hospitable people. The people there are very particular about maintaining face in public and consider it rude when people fail to do the same. It is only appropriate to return the greeting, called Wai, by pressing your hands together and bowing in respect. Thai people hold hierarchy and religious culture holy, so ensure to never disrespect the monarch or the monks and follow temple rules, like dressing modestly, removing shoes before entering temples, and avoiding displaying the soles of your feet. The Songkran festival symbolizes the Thai New Year spanning 3 days or more, April 13th-15th, splashing fun with the insane water fights that happen all over the country. Another such festival is the Loy Krathong, the Festival of Light taking place every November, which the Thai people celebrate religiously by floating baskets and releasing paper lanterns into the air believing to rid themselves of their sins. Thailand follows left-side driving. It is required of tourists to have an International Drivers’ License on them when driving and it can be used up to 6 months. Although the traffic in Thailand is no joke, keeping your anger in check is appreciated but it might be difficult for foreigners. While renting vehicles, ensure that the vehicle is insured and follow rules like wearing seatbelts and a helmet. It is better to hire a chauffeur than to drive you to places. Thai or Siamese is the native language of Thailand and it is the most used language. Owing to the economic boom because of tourism, English is also fairly common. Broken or perfect, there will be close to no language barrier, but it is useful to know a few basic sentences in Thai. Fragrance, heat, the flavor: these three things best describe Thai food. The aroma wafting out of the street shops or nearby restaurants found in Thailand will stay with you for a long time. A trip to Bangkok or Pattaya is never complete without gorging on a bowl of Thai delicious. Thai food is predominantly spicy including locally sourced seafood and meat with the influence of Vietnamese seasoning.

We'd however recommend Tsim sim card since it has good network coverage. The basic plan for Tsim starts from 800 Rs ~ 8 days for voice + data. The only acceptable currency in Thailand is the Thai Baht. The average cost of one meal/person is 60 THB which is close to 132 Rs The expenditure in Thailand for a day per person will be around 150 THB which is about Rs 450 which includes your meal & other personal expenses. We’d advise you to carry USDs while traveling to Thailand. On reaching Thailand, you can have these USDs exchanged for Thai Baht. Although Insurance is not mandatory in Thailand, it is advisable to carry one. Public hospitals are present all over the country and are as efficient as private ones while being cost-effective. Over-the-counter medicine purchases are available in almost all pharmacies, with or without a prescription for basic antibiotics, allergies, and birth control pills. It is recommended you carry sunblock, wide-brimmed hats, and shades while stepping out in the sun. If you want to avoid the sun, avoid the beaches between 10 am and 2 pm - it is the hottest then. The land of Thailand is full of people, all the time, and is a traffic zone, so it is possible to be exposed to a lot of mosquitos and ensure that you are protected by carrying a mosquito repellent. If you are bringing a sizeable amount of medicines, carry a doctor's certificate to avoid problems with the Customs. Police: 191 Ambulance: 1554 Fire department: 199

Tourism in Sri Lanka has improved over the years. Sri Lanka is a nation with a rich cultural heritage and vibrant landscapes. It has a long history of trading and cultural exchange, and it's home to a diverse range of religions and ethnicities. The country has something to offer everyone, from its stunning beaches and wildlife parks to its ancient cities and monuments. Officially called the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, this island looks like a water droplet. Here are some common facts about the country. Sri Lanka is a country of great cultural diversity. Religion permeates many aspects of life and is a fundamental element of this diversity. Buddhist and Hindu temples, mosques, and churches with their own multifaceted ceremonies are the most visible features of the cultural scene. Varying degrees of colonial influence, modernization influence, wealth, and income add further nuances to the cultural mosaic. Sri Lanka's architectural, sculptural, and painting traditions go back to ancient times. Remains of ancient works restored and preserved at archaeological sites testify to the inspiration drawn from Buddhism while reflecting Indian influences. Classical literature contains a mixture of stylistic influences from Indian and Buddhist themes. Since literati were exposed to European literature in the early 20th century, local creative writing has acquired a wider variety of styles and more secular content.  Isn’t Sri Lanka interesting? Book a Sri Lanka tour package and explore the culture-rich country. Sri Lanka has two main seasons. They are the Maha season (September to March), associated with the northeast monsoon, and the Yala season (May to August), associated with the southwest monsoon. The average temperature falls around 27–28 °C, making Sri Lanka one of the hottest countries.. During the inter-monsoon period, all parts of Sri Lanka receive steady rainfall. The best time to visit Sri Lanka depends on where you are traveling. On relatively small islands, the climate varies greatly depending on the time of year. The two monsoons that affect the island's climate; are the northeast monsoon, which affects the entire island, and the southwest monsoon, which is less strong and affects the south coast, west coast, and hilly areas. Despite the rain, temperatures on the coast rarely drop below 25 degrees. Due to the high altitude, the Hill Country is a little cooler. In general, the best time to visit the West and South Coasts and the Cultural Triangle is between December and April, while the East Coast has the best weather from May to October. Before traveling to or entering Sri Lanka, everyone must obtain a visa. However, obtaining a Sri Lanka visa is quite simple for many people, as it can be requested online (electronic travel authorization) or during arrival at the airport. A small number of countries do not qualify for an ETA or a visa on arrival, so you will need to apply for a Sri Lanka visa at the embassy. While the above two are solely for travel purposes, this allows you to stay in the country for a short period of time. There is something called the Sri Lanka Residence Visa, which includes the following categories: Depending on your nation of origin, there are three possible ways to apply for a Sri Lanka visa. When you book a Sri Lanka honeymoon package with Pickyourtrail, we will take care of all the hectic procedures involved in getting a visa so that you can just enjoy the vacation hassle-free. The easiest way to get to Sri Lanka is to fly from India, probably arriving on the same day as your departure. Sri Lanka has a busy international airport called Bandaranaike International Airport. The airport in Colombo has flights to Sri Lanka from major countries around the world. Flights to Sri Lanka are available from India, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Australia. However, as congestion increased, there was a need to manage the increase in air traffic and better accommodate tourist arrivals. Hence, the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport was opened in 2013 to meet the increasing tourist demand. The airport is located in the city of Mattala in the southernmost region of the country. However, the number of visitors to the airport soon dropped significantly, with only a few flights from the Middle East going to the airport. For this reason, the airport is considered the busiest international airport, which makes Colombo Airport a favorite among tourists. Since Sri Lanka is an island country separate from India, it is completely inaccessible by train or road. Currently, only a handful of luxury cruise ships operate from Mumbai to Colombo. The 7-day cruise departs from Mumbai and arrives in Colombo. You can reach all major destinations, like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya along the way. The sea can be rough even during storms and monsoons, so if you want to have an enjoyable vacation, it's best to book a flight. The following are the best places that you can include in your Sri Lanka Tour Package. You might think that Sri Lanka, like most Asian countries, issues visas on arrival, but this is not the case. However, it is definitely possible to apply for a visa online. This process is hassle-free and takes no time at all. Sri Lankans have no tolerance for Buddha tattoos. Don't expect them to say 'Atithi Devo Bhava' and ignore your body art if they find it offensive. Most Sri Lankan tourist guides state that travelers with Buddha tattoos in the past were arrested and deported from Sri Lanka. It may seem strange, but in many countries around the world, it is considered rude to use religious symbols and objects in fashion and jewelry. Please respect Sri Lankan culture and cover up this tattoo. Sri Lankan tuk-tuk drivers can charge you a hefty fee because you are a tourist. Before you board the tuk-tuk, always ask at least 3 locals what the price will be from your current location to your destination. You can negotiate with the tuk-tuk driver but do not be nervous and do so in a respectful manner. Pro tip: Avoid rickshaws take the buses, they are too good to travel in Sri Lanka. Considering that 1 Indian rupee is currently equivalent to 2.39 Sri Lankan rupees, you might think that you do not need to spend much money in Sri Lanka. Feeling rich, isn't it? Okay, get ready. shopping? souvenir? A turtle hatchery? water sports? Visiting a shrine? Be prepared to overcharge in destinations where locals know you're a tourist (this is basically a common trend in trendy vacation destinations). But hey, not everything is expensive. There are many experiences in Sri Lanka that cost less than $12. You can find Sri Lankan handicrafts at almost any local market. There, the shopkeeper swears authenticity and offers a high price. However, make sure that you only purchase from government-approved stores. For jewelry, you can go to Hemachandras Ltd. in Kandy. For handicrafts, you can visit Orchid House (Galle), Lakpahana (Colombo), and Laksala (Colombo), and for fashion clothing, you can visit Oder or Kandy in Colombo. Arak is the local spirit of Sri Lanka, and if you give it a try, it will definitely be a unique addition to your itinerary. Made from coconut blossoms, it tastes a bit like rum. Be sure to try the popular local beer, Lion Lager. However, be sure to purchase these only from authorized liquor stores. Sri Lanka is a perfect destination for solo female travelers. Sri Lankans are generally very polite and well-mannered people, so you are unlikely to face any security issues in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka's best travel guides recommend that simple safety precautions include dressing sensibly and making sure hotel staff and family always know where you are. Why wait more? Book Sri Lanka packages today! Most hotels in Sri Lanka have all-in-one power sockets with type D, M, G, and C chargers. You can carry a universal adapter with you just in case you need one when you are away from hotel rooms. Oh, you surely must! Driving through the most enchanting landscapes—tea plantations, forests, waterfalls, hills, and bridges—will be the treasure of a lifetime. Ella's clear, slow-moving engine is a big part of that. In addition, train fares are very cheap. If you're planning a trip on a budget, this could be a great addition to your list. Do not be surprised that most ATMs in Sri Lanka do not issue foreign cards, even in major cities such as Colombo and Kandy. Many hotels in Sri Lanka also do not offer credit card withdrawals. Shoulders and feet must be covered in Buddhist temples. It is enough to cover the shoulders with a scarf (make sure the scarf does not come loose). Also, unlike many shrines in India, head coverings are prohibited in Buddhist temples. To avoid unnecessary embarrassment, always follow these dress tips on your trip to Sri Lanka. Most international networks don't work in Sri Lanka, so don't spend your trip desperately looking for a signal. Get his local SIM card at the airport and get as much data as you need for the internet. It doesn't cost much. If you forget to buy one at the airport, you can ask the hotel staff to buy it for you at any time, or you can buy it yourself at the nearest market. In Sri Lanka, if you plan to explore the area without renting a car, it is wise to carry a backpack rather than hand luggage or suitcases. A scarf is useful when going to a temple, and a skirt that covers the knees is useful for men. Be sure to pack a jacket or two and a sweater if you plan to travel to the foothills of the region. One of the most important things to know before traveling to Sri Lanka is that the island is inhabited by many ethnic groups and everyone celebrates their own holidays, so there is no shortage of holidays. That's it. It's also important to note that life in Sri Lanka has its own pace, so you may have to wait a little longer than usual. But it's okay. Because what better way to spend a holiday than chilling and relaxing with friends? Right? It is always helpful to have travel insurance before you leave your home country. Even if nothing bad has happened on your trip so far, it's always in your best interest to get things done before it's too late. It's better to be safe than sorry. Sri Lanka is the perfect tourist destination for travelers looking for a mix of culture and nature.

Having made its name as a land which gave birth to one of the greatest philosophers like Socrates, Pythagoras, and Aristotle, the country of Greece has much more to offer to tourists than being an epitome of ancient mythology. This is the place where ideas of theatres and the Olympic Games originated from. Apart from its heritage, the country has been successful in pulling the attention of tourists towards its scenic beaches and breathtaking landmarks. GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES OF GREECE The country of Greece occupies a part of Southeastern Europe, situated in the southern part of the Balkan peninsula. Consisting mainly of mountainous regions, Greece is a paradise for trekkers. Greece is characterized predominantly by the Mediterranean climate which varies from region to region receiving hot summers and wet winters. The country is a shelter to a population of more than 10 million in an area spread around 131,957 square kilometres. CULTURE OF GREECE Greece’s culture carries a strong influence from the history of the Roman empire and Byzantine empire. It is the reason behind the birth of western culture and the idea of democracy. Modern culture in Greece has derived influence from other nations and cultures including the Venetian empire, the Genoese Republic, the Ottoman Empire and the British Empire. Apart from this, Greece carries with itself a rich heritage of visual arts, literature, and architecture. Around 98% of the Greek population follows the Greek Orthodox Christian Faith. PLACES TO VISIT IN GREECE During their trip to Greece, one is sure to pay a visit to the capital city Athens which is a worldwide name for its history which is as old as 3400 years. The city boasts sublime monuments and remarkable representations of Greek mythology. Once you're free from Athens, the city of Santorini introduces you to a fantasy world filled with blue and white houses. History lovers can head to the cities of Hersonissos and Rethymnon to get versed in the ancient architecture of Greece. Apart from this, Mykonos town pulls the masses for its offbeat setting with charming windmills. THINGS TO DO IN GREECE Not just a place to crack historical mysteries, Greece serves a plethora of exciting activities one can engage in with their loved ones. A stroll across the colourful streets of Chania town is enough to rejuvenate your mind with the love of your life. The Chania Venetian Lighthouse is a perfect place to witness enchanting views of the city. If you’re a beach bum, then the beach town of Tsilivi is the best option to cater to all your beachy temptations. Hikers can expect the trekking spots of Zagori to fulfil their cravings for sightseeing in the mountains. To end, a trip to Greece is incomplete without exploring the ancient Greek pieces of architecture in the city of Athens which answers all your questions relating to Greek mythology. Public Transport Most cities in Greece are small enough to be explored by foot. The only cities you'll require public transport at are Athens, Patra, Kalamata and Thessaloniki of which only Athens is large enough to have an underground metro network. KTEL (Koino Tamio Eis Praxeon Leoforion) are blue/orange/teal-green painted, long-distances busses that run in almost every urban city and are modern and comfortable. The busses in villages are unfortunately older and less comfortable, these buses run on a daily schedule and stop mostly outside coffee houses. Also, the busses in rural areas do not facilitate sign boards or timetables in English, it's best to head to the nearest station and enquire in person. Remember to checkin your seat number which is noted on the bus ticket and labeled on the back of the seats. Taxi & Airport transfer Getting a taxi from Athens airport to the city is a pretty sorted task and so is the fair break up. There will be a line of yellow-coloured taxis right outside the arrival hall, wait in the queue and when your turn comes, the police personnel will signal you. The fare from the airport to the city is fixed and includes all costs and taxes. You will be charged 3100 from 5AM till midnight and 4050 between 12AM and 5AM. Keep in mind that the driver might try to overcharge you, so be informed about the rates and make sure he turns the meter on. Transport & city passes In Greece, Athens offers two flat fare passes, one for travel within the city, which includes downtown and suburbs, and is not valid on any long distance buses/Orange/KTEL/E22/Airports. The second flat fare pass is for long distance travel from the airport to out of the city limit. These passes prove to be very economical as compared to cost of renting a car or buying single trip paper tickets. Greece also offers a special 3 day (72 hrs) 'visitors' pass with unlimited travel all around the city and trips to the airport too, it costs 1220 INR. Driving & Car rental Most cities in Greece are not that large and do not require car rentals. If you want to drive your way between two cities, there are various car rental service providers, some of the popular ones being Alamo, Budget and others depending on which website you are booking from. A car rental will cost you anywhere between 4000-8000 INR/Day and note that the price of fuel in Greece is on the higher side. Make sure to abide by the road rules and other safety measures applicable to Greece. Culture & EtiquettePeople in Greece are very laid back and welcoming, they are known for their hospitality. When you are over at a friend's place for dinner in Greece, do not refuse food, as it is taken as a sign of insult, and if you have to, do give a reason. Asking for a second serving is considered a compliment and indicates that you like the food. While meeting strangers let someone introduce you, and greet them with a firm handshake. People in Greece might ask personal questions that you are not used to, but they mean no harm. In fact, it is just their way of developing relationships beyond a formal level. Major events & Public holidaysGreece is the land of festivals and celebrations and most holidays are celebrated with zest and excitement, some of which are Easter, the Carnival season- Apokreas, Independence day and Agios Pnevmatos. Festivals like christmas are considered personal and are celebrated in respective houses, but you'll still see the entire country covered in beautiful lights. Another intersting festival in Greece is the 'Saint's day', each church in the country is devoted to a particular saint and the saint's name day is celebrated with a festival (panigiri), so enquire about when the panigiris of the church you are visiting is and if it happens to be during your stay, tag along and be a part of the celebration. Road rules and driving licenseGreece follows right-hand side driving. Short-term visitors (up to 90 days) from other countries, including the USA, Australia and Canada, may drive in Greece with their national licence, but they must also have an International Driving Permit (IDP) or "notarized" (officially certified) translation of their drivers license before coming. Know your Greek Greek is the main language spoken by the locals which is also the official language of Greece, and almost 99% of the population are native Greek speakers. Most of the locals do not speak fluent English. So, the following words will be of great help for anyone wanting to hold a conversation with the locals. Hello - Chaírete How are you? - Pós eísai? Good morning - Kaliméra Good evening - Kaló apógevma Thank you - Efcharistó Excuse me - Me synchoreíte Sorry - Sygnómi How much does this cost? - Póso kostízei aftó? The cuisines in Greece is inspired by age old recipes, belief in tradition, quality ingredients and the right combinations to create a beautiful symphony of flavours. A trip to Greece is a trip back in time, back to traditional cuisines. Amygdalota: Amygdalota is an almond cookie that tastes perfect with a cup of coffee. In Greece, Amygdalota represents good times and warm relationships. Courgette Balls: Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, Courgette Balls are a hint of mint and a dash of salty feta cheese. Tomatokeftedes: A hint of mint, tomato and onion to please your taste buds, these tomato fritters are a traditional element of the Santorini cuisine. Feta Me Meli: Honey drizzled filo pastry with salty feta stuffing, Feta Me Meli plays the perfect symphony of sweet and salty flavours. Bougatsa: Semolina custard covered in phyllo pastry sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon on top, best enjoyed on the streets of Greece. Dolmadakia: Ground lamp/beef covered in grape leaves for the authentic Greek touch. Ellinikos: Served in long copper cups called ‘birki’, Ellinikos is Greece's favourite style of coffee. Frappe: Water mixed with powdered instant coffee is all that goes into this addictive, frothy and cold authentic Greek coffee.

To enjoy additional benefits CONNECT WITH US April 22, 2019 06:14 pm | Updated 06:14 pm IST CHENNAI : TAMILNADU : 27/03/2019 :FOR METROPLUS : Pickyourtrails founders Hari Ganapathy and Srinath Shankar in Chennai on Wednesday 27th March 2019 . Photo: K. Pichumani/ The Hindu Srinath Shankar’s grand plans of backpacking across Europe were shot down when his visa got rejected twice, in 2009 and in 2010. “It was the recession period, and I was a solo traveller. So they thought I could be a potential immigrant,” laughs Srinath. Today, he has 30-plus approved visa stamps on his passport. With friend and business partner Hari Ganapathy, Srinath explores new places across the globe and helps others do the same. In 2014, the duo started PickYourTrail, a travel technology startup that plans international holidays. Recently, the company also received close to three million dollars (around ₹21 crores) in a Series A round of funding, led by GoFrugal CEO Kumar Vembu and iThought ideator-founder Shyam Sekhar, which was joined by Entrust CIO Rajagopal Subramanian and Freshworks founder-CEO Girish Mathrubootham. “For the first seven months it was just us,” says Hari, “Then we hired around six people. We have a team of 100-plus now and a bunch of campus recruits are joining us soon.” The 33-year-olds, both alumni of Vivekananda College, first met during a college play. They kept in touch, hung out often and found corporate jobs in Bengaluru post-MBA. In fact, Srinath’s first trip to Europe was in 2012, when he accompanied Hari on a family holiday. Hari’s parents, wife and her parents and relatives were all part of this trip, Srinath’s visa was approved for the group trip. In 19 days, they went across France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Spain. “We attended the La Tomatina festival in Bunol (Spain), went to small European towns, and stayed in a 125-year-old apartment in Rome, where they had a family tree dating back 400 years,” says Hari. The entire trip was self booked. “Rail Europe was most sought after but we booked on independent local train websites like Trenitalia and sncf.com,” says Srinath. After the holiday, they received a lot of queries. That’s when they understood that more people want to travel on their own, but are not sure how to do so. “Going to Europe was considered an elite thing. What was on offer was limited. Information too was limited. Not many knew of the existence of budget carriers such as Ryanair or Easy Jet. We realised it must be overwhelming for people who wanted to plan a trip,” says Srinath. This got them thinking, and for six months they tried to figure out if they could start something in the travel space. Eventually Srinath and Hari moved to Chennai and started PickYourTrail. “A lot of our batchmates were getting married around that time and they asked for our itinerary for their honeymoons. Thanks to that, our customer count went up to around 600 in the first year,” laughs Srinath. The website had a simple landing page with a photograph of the island of Santorini and the words: Personalised vacations crafted by travellers. “In about a week, we had 1,000 sign ups. We started speaking to customers to understand what they wanted, their interests, dislikes... One of our first clients was a group of ladies who wanted to go to Chiang Mai for the Lantern Festival. They had a fabulous trip,” says Hari. The team has built a personalised algorithm that takes into account around 40 factors such as time of travel, duration, preferences, ratings... to create personalised itineraries. After the booking, clients use PickYourTrail’s app track bookings, weather updates, city-specific recommendations, real time flight information and for on-trip chat support. Meanwhile Srinath and Hari are kicked about their recent holiday in Japan. “There are some great flight fares available this time,” informs Hari. Japan is seeing a lot of tourists this year. Southeast Asia, too, is in demand. “An interesting trend picking up is last-minute, short-haul vacations. Clients do three nights in Bali or a weekend trip to Krabi, Dubai, Singapore or Malaysia. With many countries offering visa on arrival, it makes it easier,” says Srinath. These are mostly 25 to 30-year-olds, he adds. And of course nowadays Instagram plays a role. After all, who doesn’t like their #vacation posts trending? The Hindu MetroPlus

Malaysia has long been a top entry on the bucket list of many travelers. The country’s hype is not unfounded as it is a region of many eclectic blends. One can find ancient customs, traditions, and culture all existing seamlessly with modern touches in many parts of the country. The country offers attractions like beaches, quaint picturesque towns, many renowned heritage sites, and adventure hotspots. With so much to soak in, Malaysia holiday packages are some of the most sought-after deals in travel circles. If you are looking for such a tour package then look no further than Pickyourtrail. Pickyourtrail offers an exhaustive list of customizable packages. So, go ahead and choose one that best suits your needs. Top-Selling Malaysia Tour Package Malaysia Trip Duration Malaysia Tour Package Price Malaysia is a multicultural land. It offers its tourists a wide variety of fun engagements to partake in no matter what their budgets or tastes may be. The country has both modern cities and smaller towns that are pleasantly old-fashioned. One can hop from cosmopolitan city attractions like shopping hubs to monasteries in a matter of hours. Such is the range of Malaysia. Given the variety that is on offer, here is a list of the 10 best places in Malaysia worth visiting:- Petronas Twin Towers, Kuala Lumpur - Standing tall at a height of 452 meters, the Petronas Twin Towers are the tallest in the whole world. This behemoth has a total of 88 floors which are accessible by an impressive total number of 76 elevators. With so much to see and enjoy, the Petronas Twin Towers make for a great addition to your Malaysia tour package. Batu Caves, Selangor - These cave systems are located just an hour away from Kuala Lumpur. These consist of three main caves in addition to many smaller ones. A visit here is sure to leave you with an otherworldly feeling, such as the charm of these hidden attractions. This makes it a worthwhile addition to your Malaysia package. Mount Kinabalu, Sabah - Mount Kinabalu is the tallest mountain in all of Malaysia. It comes under Kinabalu Park. This park is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the oldest parks in the country. Mount Kinabalu is a challenging and beautiful attraction that deserves a spot on Malaysia tour packages from India. Perhentian Islands - Perhentian Islands have all the idyllic quality one expects on a tropical escape. Historically, it was a stop for traders traveling in Southeast Asia. Over time, it has become part of a marine park and subsequently a major tourist destination as well. There are 2 major islands here that offer modern amenities. These are Pulau Perhentian Besar and Pulau Perhentian Kecil. Sipadan Islands - The Sipadan Islands and the surrounding water make for the richest marine habitat in the entire world. It is home to several species of land and aquatic wildlife - hawksbill turtles, monitor lizards, whale sharks, and much more. Gunung Mulu National Park - The sixth entry on our list is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is most popular because of its karst limestone pinnacles, but its massive caves are just as spectacular. It involves ropes, harnesses, and a lot more, and as we said earlier - poses a challenge. This offbeat destination deserves a place on your Malaysia tour package from India. Penang Hills - Penang Hill’s peaks are accessible via Penang Hill Railways. It is an air-conditioned locomotive that covers a 2007-meter-long climb in a mere 10 minutes at most. There are mid-stops in a way that are used if requested by the passengers. The biggest highlight of this attraction is the views that can be seen from the top of the hills. Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre - If you consider yourself an animal lover, then you definitely can’t miss out on this one. The Sepilok Orangutan Rehabilitation Centre was established in 1964. It aims to rescue orphaned orangutan babies from the pet trade or illegal hunting. It not only rescues the creatures but also helps them learn to survive in the wild so that they can one day be released back into the Kabili-Sepilok Forest Reserve. Kek Lok Si Temple, George Town - Kek Lok Si is the country’s largest Buddhist temple. It sits at the bottom of Air Itam mountain.

If you are visiting Phuket in summer, opt for light, airy fabrics that will keep you cool in the humid weather and choose bright colours or patterns to stand out against the night sky. Go for comfortable shoes that you can use for dancing in the beach’s nightclub. However, if you are visiting Phuket in monsoon, make sure to pack warm clothes like sweaters or woolen fabrics to avoid the cool weather. Also, wear shoes that are less slippery since it will be raining. What not to do in Phuket? 1. Don't overspend on your accommodation. There are plenty of affordable places to stay, so don't blow your budget on a luxury hotel.
2. Don't eat at tourist traps as the food is usually overpriced at tourist places and not as good as street food or local restaurants.
3. Don't drink tap water. Stick to bottled water to avoid getting sick.
4. Don't neglect your sunscreen to avoid getting sunburned. Do they speak English in Phuket? Although not everyone in Phuket speaks English, you can find that many people in tourist areas do.

This is not the ideal time to visit Phuket due to the increased chance of rain and the potential for bad weather. If you must travel to Phuket during this time, be sure to pack appropriately and be prepared for chilly weather. Is it worth going to Phuket in August? August is the month with heavy rain and little sunshine and a cool breeze. While this may not be the best time of year to visit for a vacation, the place is less crowded and you can find great deals on hotels and airfare. Is September good to visit Phuket? The rainy season in Phuket typically starts in September, and while this can be a great time to get cheaper rates at hotels and resorts, the weather is not ideal for beach-going or outdoor activities. If you are planning a trip to Phuket during this time, be sure to pack your rain gear and prepare for some wet weather. Is October a good time to visit Phuket?

The Bali Swing Ubud has been such a success that hundreds of others have sprouted up around Bali. It's difficult to travel 100 yards without seeing a swing or a sign for one. The fad has exploded since the first photographs of people dangling above the forest surfaced on Instagram. The original is located just outside of Ubud (and is undoubtedly one of Bali's most Instagrammable locations), but there are plenty more excellent choices that we will discuss in this guide. Do add this to your Bali package. The official Ubud Bali Swing consists of multiple distinct swings of differing heights, with more being created at the time. As of now, there are 15 swings, and we doubt that these will be the last. These look out over a magnificent palm tree valley with a river, providing the impression of a true Balinese rainforest. It's truly a stunning environment, and it's easy to see why it's so popular. We are sure that you'll be hooked with just one glimpse of the place. 1. Bali nests are another Instagram favourite that can be seen all around the island. The one at the original Bali Swing is a top favourite. It is remote and calm, with a breathtaking view! 2. Access to the nests that are placed high in a tree is through ladders that make the whole process quite simple. These are removed afterwards so that you will feel as though are fully hanging from the trees! 3. For safety, tourists have a rope wrapped around their waist. However, the nest doesn’t move much. So, as a result, one can do without them, but you are meant to wear them nonetheless. The upside is that the rope is not overtly distracting. 4. The nests are included in the price of your Bali Swing ticket, so make use of them as well! 5. Whether you're travelling alone in Bali or with someone who doesn't like taking photographs, the Bali Swing now provides a photography service. You may have a photographer take photographs of you on the swings or nests for 175k rupiah (about 1000 rupees)! 6. The Bali Swing is really popular, so we recommend that you arrive as soon as it opens. The earlier the better! You don't want to have to deal with a queue forming while you're attempting to obtain the ideal photo. 7. Even at 9 a.m., it can get really crowded. We recommend arriving for the 8 a.m. opening hours to avoid the crowds and needles stress. Following are some places to visit near the Bali swing: Discover a variety of Bali packages by Theme such as: Bali Honeymoon Packages, Bali Family Packages, Bali Beach Packages, Bali Adventure Packages, Bali Budget Packages, Bali Luxury Packages, Bali Kid Friendly Packages, Bali Group Packages, Bali Private Pool Villa Packages, Bali Photoshoot Packages, Bali Packages for Solo Travellers, Bali Surf Holidays Packages, Bali Land Tour Packages, Bali Temple Tour Packages, Bali Water Sports Packages, Bali Safari Packages, Bali Scuba Diving Packages, Bali New Year Packages, Bali Baby Moon Packages, Bali Water Villa Packages.

International Holidays Honeymoon Getaways Packages by City Packages by Interest Dry Season (April - October): This is the most popular time to visit Bali, as the weather is generally sunny and pleasant. Expect lower humidity and minimal rainfall during this period, making it an ideal time for outdoor activities and relaxation. Wet Season (November - March): While the wet season sees more rainfall and higher humidity, it doesn't mean that Bali is off-limits. In fact, it's during this time that Bali's lush landscapes come to life. However, be prepared for occasional heavy rains and brief thunderstorms. Consult Your Healthcare Provider: Before booking your Bali Baby moon, consult with your healthcare provider to ensure that it is safe for you to travel during your pregnancy. Discuss any specific medical considerations and obtain necessary vaccinations or medications, if required. Choose Pregnancy-Friendly Activities: While Bali offers a wide range of activities, it's important to select those that are pregnancy-friendly. Opt for gentle experiences like spa treatments, scenic walks, and cultural tours. Avoid strenuous activities, and always prioritise your comfort and safety. Select Accommodations Wisely: Choose accommodations that cater to the needs of expectant mothers. Look for resorts that offer comfortable and spacious rooms, prenatal spa treatments, and easy access to amenities.

The American and Dutch warships attempted but failed to pull the ship to the Old Singaraja Sea Port in North Bali. Further on, the volcanic activity on Mount Agung carried the ship that was sitting on Tulamben beach 25 metres into the sea.

The waterfalls at the Plitvice National Park are a wonder of nature and need to feature on your Croatia travel packages.

The ticket to the park can be bought online and all the seasons except winter are a good time to visit this nature’s wonder. Like any other place in the world, Croatia experiences 4 seasons in a year. The best time to visit climate-wise is the Summer followed by the Autumn and Spring while the winter months are not recommended on the other hand. The summer months bring in the herds of travellers so our suggestion would be to plan your Croatia tourism from India in the Autumn or Spring. The summer months from June to August are considered to be the peak season in Croatia. The weather is still cool in these months and encourages trips across the country and frequent visits to the beaches. The sun shines for about 8-9 hours and the central parts receive more rainfall when compared with the coasts. The Spring ( Late March-May ) and Autumn ( September to Early November ) months are considered to be the shoulder months. During these months the floating tourist population reduces along with a substantial decrease in the cost of the stay. This is a result of the decrease in the number of daylight hours as we move close to November. The winter months of December, January and February are considered to be the low seasonal months for Croatia. During the months the temperatures are low as 3 °C along with the country receiving sunshine only for about 2-3 hours a day. Thus very few traveler groups look to explore the lands. The stay cost will be high during the festive season but during the Christmas and New year but see a drop during the rest of the period. Croatia has about 6 international airports. These are the Dubrovnik Airport, Zadar Airport, Sofia Airport, Rijeka Airport, Pula Airport and Zagreb Airport. The Zagreb airport is the biggest airport receiving the highest number of flights. There are direct flights to Dubrovnik, Split and Zagreb from India. If not, most places in Croatia have single-stop flights with layovers in European cities. The leading airline is the Croatia airlines with decent connectivity and pricing. But the various options to choose for your Croatian travel package include Lufthansa, Air India, Jet Airways, Air France, Etihad, British Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Qatar Airways. Traveling to Croatia from India is not possible due to obvious reasons. You would have to take a flight and reach another European country first to take a road trip to Croatia. This could be UK or Germany. Taking a bus or train from Italy, Bosnia, Hungary, Germany and Serbia also can be considered as an alternative. Just like there are no direct routes on land leading to Croatia from India, the best and easiest way to reach Croatia via sea would be on a ferry from Italy.

The best time to visit the country would ideally depend on 4 major things – the places you wish to visit, the weather you would like to experience, activities you would like to do and of course the budget. In order to help you decide the best time that suits your preferences, a detailed description of the seasons is given below. The peak season is also the summer season in Iceland. The months of June, July and August are warm with clear skies and make it the perfect time for tourists to visit the country. During this season, the country is most likely to be brimming with people from all over the world to witness the midnight sun, phenomenal glacier lagoons and breathtaking landscapes. You could also see the whales and puffins bask in the open. It also makes it the perfect time for a hassle free drive around the country. On the flip side, the prices are relatively high during this season due to the extensive footfall. If you’re looking for the perfect weather and expensive Iceland package deals, this season would best suit your needs. The months of April, May, September and October are the best months for tourists to visit during the off peak season. This is also when Iceland experiences its spring and autumn seasons. This season is still a good time for a drive around the country but, it is always better to be prepared for dramatic weather to kick in. Though the weather is moderately better than the winter season, it is quite unpredictable as Iceland experiences rough weather on some days during the shoulder season. Most of the activities and attractions are open during this time of the year as well. Considering the footfall is not as much as the peak season, the prices are a bit affordable. If you’re looking for an offbeat experience in Iceland, this is the perfect time for you to take the trips to Iceland offered by us. Early November to late March, marks the off peak season in Iceland. It is also the winter season where the landscapes are covered with an inch of snow. Self driving during this season is highly not recommended as the roads get slippery due to the ice formed and the weather gets very rough. Hence, it is best to take group tours around the country. The country gets a maximum of 4 to 5 hours of sunlight during the winter season. However, this is the best time to experience the hot springs and predominantly the Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis. If you’re looking for a cozy and value for money Iceland vacation packages, this would be the best season to cut down on your Iceland travel cost from India. If you are looking to experience a colder version of Europe, it is Iceland you have been looking for. Often clubbed with France and London holidays, Iceland is blanketed as an established tourist destination on its own. Iceland is geographically divided into 8 regions - Capital Region, Southern Peninsula, West, Westfjords, Northwest, Northeast, East and South. India is about 8302 KM away from Iceland and hence taking a flight is one of the best means to reach Iceland from India.

The climate is practically immaculate as of now with long periods of daylight. This season will, in general, be the most costly however number of tourists can be seen during this time. So in the event that you need to lessen costs, you can plan your Paris Package in the Spring a long time between March-May when the city is by all accounts stirring. On the other hand, Autumn is additionally a favourable time to visit, in spite of the fact that the days are shorter, Paris is in blossoming hues, with hotels offering maximum limits and offers. Spring and Summer seasons make for the best time to visit Paris. The temperatures range from 4-19 degrees Celsius and 13-24 degrees Celsius from March to May and June to August respectively. This means that the weather is perfect for sightseeing. There are also several notable festivals that are celebrated during these periods to add to one’s cheer. These six months are the best time to visit if you want to enjoy the city like the locals do. Shoulder Season in Paris sets in from September and lasts until November. One can experience temperatures ranging from 5 to 21 degrees Celsius during this period. Given the cooler weather with a slight nip in the air, this makes for a good time to visit the city as the crowds start to thin out. Paris has its low season of tourism from December to February. The city experiences a drop in mercury during this period with temperatures ranging from 2-8 degrees Celsius. As a result, winters in Paris can get cold and wet. However, there is an ethereal beauty to the city which comes to the forefront when it starts snowing. The elements never hamper any activity with the frost and snow clearing out in a day or two. We definitely recommend that you schedule your trip accordingly so you celebrate both Christmas and New Year’s in Paris as they are on another level entirely. The Moulin Rouge isn't only a spot, however, the experience of a lifetime; a destination enhanced by music, move, diversion, nourishment and culture. This incredible men's club has charmed famous personalities and worldwide big names like Edith Piaf, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Elton John throughout the years. While I was on the way it’s red shading surely, in each sense, portrays the brilliance, energy, affect-ability and sentiment that is held inside the dividers of this fabulous fascination. Moulin Rouge is an enthusiastic spot that permits various types of individuals to blend, empowering them to have discussions and show themselves a great time on their Paris tour packages. A day was well spent here. Spread across 4800 sections of land, Disneyland Paris is a mix of fervour and rush because of an assortment of areas of amusement, extending from energising rides, shopping, eating, and resorts, to a tremendous fairway. I was very much excited to go to Disneyland. This is the most loved place by tourists. Disneyland Paris was opened in 1992 and around 15 million guests visit every year. It is made out of two amusement parks - The Disneyland Park and Walt Disney Studios Park which are a must add on your Disneyland Paris packages. There's a gigantic different type of attractions inside the recreation center, yet the most vital ones are Buzz Lightyear's Laser Blast, Big Thunder Mountain and the Mad Hatter's Tea Cups. The French historical center of Louvre is a milestone landmark in the city of Paris which stands tall with the tag of the world's biggest exhibition hall and is a must add on your Paris holiday packages. It was on my itinerary for a long time. The Louvre Museum has more than 380,000 works available, yet just a bunch are in plain view in the show segment, with eminent craftsmanships from Leonardo Da Vinci, Vermeer, Michelangelo, Rembrandt, and Eugène Delacroix. Other than the craftsmanships here, I saw the glass pyramid which fills in as the principal access to the gallery and the Inverted Pyramid worked as a piece of the Grand Louvre plan are the other star attractions of this spot. Also, the extraordinary arts like Egyptian collectibles, Greek, Etruscan and Roman Antiquities, Islamic Art, Sculptures, Decorative Arts, Paintings, Prints and Drawings with the Mona Lisa by Leonardo Da Vinci is the most acclaimed display which I had ever seen. Arranged close to the Latin Quarters, the Luxembourg Gardens is the second biggest open park in Paris. I was amazed to see the natural beauty of this park. The nursery of the French Senate is roused by the Boboli Gardens in Florence. It is set in the midst of rich greenery, this spot is immaculate to relish the fresh air while you watch local people on your Paris packages from India. I also witnessed the apathetic night getting the hang of beekeeping, playing chess or basically unwinding. The Eiffel tower is one location that simply cannot be missed on a trip to Paris. This is partly because this tower in many ways symbolises Paris. Other than checking out this iconic marvel itself on their visit, tourists can also view the city from three levels. There is something rather special about checking out the views of the city that get smaller and smaller under you. Before you head out to see this marvel for yourself, It is advised you purchase the skip the line pack while on your Paris tour package so that you maximise your time to see the monument. The Versailles Palace is as large as it is eye-catching. With more than 700 rooms combined, it is easily one of the biggest palaces in the whole world. It is famous for being home to royal occupants from King Louis XIV to Marie-Antoinette. Some of the highlights of your Paris package during your visit can be - the glittering Hall of Mirrors, the beautifully decorated rooms, and of course the priceless art. All these factors combine to give you an unforgettable glimpse of royal life. Given all that is to see and absorb here, this easily makes for a day-long outing. If you seek to experience older Paris, then there is no better place to do it than the Latin Quarter. It was first settled by the Romans back in the 1st century. Over time, this famous neighbourhood has attracted hordes of bohemians, scholars, and much more. There is plenty to see and do here. One can have a drink at the brasseries which were frequented back in the day by noted visionaries like Hemingway, Sartre, etc. Tourists can also check out tombs of fallen heroes and intellectuals. Lastly, the Ladt and the Unicorn tapestries located at the Cluny Museum make for a good visit as well. This is just the tip of the iceberg as the more one looks in this locale, the more one can discover. The beautiful Notre Dame was built back in the middle ages. This iconic marvel perfectly embodies the splendours of Gothic architecture. While sadly, the devastating fires wreaked havoc on this gorgeous structure, one can view the restoration work progressing steadily from the outside. One can still admire the flying buttresses and the high towers on the exterior. So, even though one cannot view the sculptures, statues, paintings and whatnot currently, a visit to Notre Dame is still more than justified on your Paris travel packages. We suggest you head to the left bank of the Seine River for the best views of the structure. Montmartre once used to be a separate village. However, since 1860, it has been included as a part of Paris. Even so, with its winding lanes, several trees, and picturesque hillside, it seems different from the rest of the city. Some of the main attractions worth checking out here include - The basilica of the Sacré Coeur, Moulin Rouge theatre, etc. Other than that, one can simply stroll down the streets here as that makes for an engaging activity in itself. It isn’t hard to picture the artists and musicians who called this neighbourhood home several decades back when rents were considerably cheaper. All in all, this is definitely a magical neighbourhood that one should not miss out on their Paris trip package. Occupying a former train station, Musée d’Orsay houses a splendid collection of world-renowned Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art. Crowds throng here to view masterpieces from famous artists like Monet, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and many more. What adds to your experience are the sweeping views of the entire city that can be enjoyed from the rooftop terrace. With amazing views both indoors and outdoors, this is one attraction that one simply can’t miss on their Paris tour package from India. The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most recognizable attractions to be seen in Paris. This massive structure was commissioned by Napoleon back in 1806. It was erected to celebrate his army’s conquests across Europe. However, he never was able to see it with his own eyes as he was exiled and dead by the time it was completed 30 years later. This attraction is surrounded by a busy traffic rotary where 12 major streets come together in convergence. This is one attraction we suggest you don’t miss on your Paris package. The Rodin Museum can perhaps be regarded as one of the most romantic museums in all of Paris. With its lush sculpture garden and location in a marvellous 18th-century Rococo mansion, tourists here will certainly be swept off their feet. The main draw here is the sensual sculpture - "The Kiss" which depicts two lovers. This attraction is not to be missed on your Paris holiday packages if you are a fan of art and can appreciate Auguste Rodin’s boundary-breaking path. Paris is a city filled with traditional architecture, in such a landscape the Pompidou Centre definitely stands out. Its edgy design elements with brightly coloured tubes and exposed mechanical systems were critically judged when it first opened. However, the fact remains that this architectural marvel from Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers still stands out from the rest of the city. One can enjoy artworks and sculptures on the inside, besides the video and sound installation which make this museum immensely popular. A cemetery may not strike many as a famous attraction, but the Père Lachaise Cemetery is the exception to this rule. Its celebrity graves, haunting statues, and cobblestone lanes are not only photo-worthy but also one of the best attractions in the city. This aptly named "City of the Dead" are part landscaped gardens and part burial gardens. From macabre skulls to plump winged cherubs, one can find everything here. It is also worth noting that there are many famous personalities laid to rest here. Built after the Panthéon in Rome, the Panthéon in Paris was built in the 18th century. Located in the 5th district in the Latin Quarter, its main objective was to pay tribute to significant personalities. Many great French Republic’s notable personalities are buried here, like - Simone Veil and her husband, Jean Moulin, Victor Hugo, and so on. Its one-of-a-kind architecture makes it a must-visit on your Paris travel package from India. We assure you that you will be thoroughly amazed by the beauty of this marvel.

Norway is known to be perhaps the most secure nation on the planet. Crime percentages are very low even in significant urban areas. For example, Oslo, Bergen, Trondheim, and Stavanger are the safest to visit on your India to Norway tour packages. The climate, as referenced above, changes a great deal between seasons in Norway so you generally need to bring enough garments. Above all, in case you're wanting to go on certain climbs during your visit, you have to bring an additional layer of garments. 
It’s an obvious fact that Norway is a costly nation to visit. Despite the fact that it's more affordable since the Norwegian Krone is powerless, it's not modest. One approach to abstain from going through an excess of cash during your movements in Norway is to eat less at cafés on your Norway tour packages. Other than the Polar Bears on Svalbard, there are no perilous creatures holding on to assault you in the Norwegian wild. Possibly you're in the forested areas, on a mountain or on an icy mass, you don't have anything to fear.

March is the best time to go to Norway for augmenting light hours and snowfall in winter sports resorts and as April goes to May you'll discover a bounty of wild blossoms and bloom showing up in nation knolls just as a considerable measure of slushy snow underneath. June, July and August are positively the greatest months to go to Norway regarding temperatures and sunlight hours in spite of the fact that costs will be including some hidden costs as will midges and other bitey creepy crawlies in and around the marshlands towards the north of the nation.

November days are cold and dim with hardly any going on separated from snow mists coming full circle on higher grounds and the Northern Lights beginning to react to conditions.

It is an alluring city perched on a rock that draws tourists with its elegance, beauty, and charms. Budapest's Ecseri Flea Market is a great destination for shoppers. Visitors can shop for a range of unique goods at the market, which is situated on the outskirts of the city. On your way home, it's an excellent market to haggle and pick up some unique gifts. The market offers a wide variety of goods, including clothing, home goods, ceramics, furniture, weaponry, and toys. One of Warsaw's most well-known streets, The Royal Way, has opulent wonders to discover. The Old Town, where this famous street finishes, offers vistas of vibrant buildings, shops, and other sights. The street is around 2 kilometres long and it may take a half-day to walk the entire Royal Way while exploring and halting at various significant monuments. The Royal Way is a must-visit location because it is home to the Royal Castle, Krasiski Palace and Garden, Presidential Palace, Pisudski Square, and Saxon Garden. It is impossible to visit Vienna without indulging in a decadent slice of Sachertorte, the city's emblematic cake. Chocolate sponge, dark chocolate ganache, and apricot jam make a delicious combination. Seize the chance to indulge in a mouthwatering Sachertorte and pamper yourself. To sample this wonderful treat, go to the Café Sacher, Café Demel, or Aida Café Konditorei. Moscow's most recognisable structure is none other than St. Basil's Cathedral. Built in 1555, this outstanding example of architecture is well renowned for its intricate Byzantine and Asian design and lavish interiors. Inside the cathedral, there are nine different chapels, each of which is adorned with eye-catching murals in vibrant colours. You should absolutely include a visit to this exquisite monument in your travel itinerary to Eastern Europe. Despite the fact that it may sound uninteresting, one of the most pleasurable and memorable experiences you can have in Prague is a simple walk across the famous 14th century bridge. Charles IV commissioned the bridge in 1357, and it was finished in 1390 and the eye-catching statues were added in the 17th century. The Charles Bridge has been known by this name since the 19th century. Air travel is the most effective method for getting to Eastern Europe from India. Flying is the most convenient, comfortable, and quickest way to travel to Eastern Europe.

Scandinavian countries are widely considered to be the most beautiful not only in Europe but the entire world. While most people tend to think of the Northern lights when thinking of these lands, there is so much to see and enjoy here. Scandinavia includes various different countries, all of which are special in their own ways. The few common elements that they all share are some of the biggest draws to tourists as well. These include - welcoming and culture-rich inhabitants. A culture that consists of legendary gods, myths, and intriguing mysteries. However, the biggest draw here has to be the incredibly dramatic and rich landscape to be seen here. If you are looking for Scandinavia tour packages online, then your search ends at Pickyourtrail. Pickyourtrail offers you the best deals and discounts on your travel packages. So, go online and choose one that best suits your preferences and requirements. The list of countries in Scandinavia includes something for every tourist. One can enjoy both outdoor and indoor engagements here. With options ranging from Finland to Denmark and Sweden to Greenland. Each of these has its own unique and pressing draws. This makes Scandinavian countries a mandatory destination on every bucket list. Scandinavian countries include Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. With time, however, they have also come to include Finland and Iceland. Like we mentioned earlier there are countless things to see and do here. For example - Finland is considered to be Santa’s village. That’s just the beginning- Denmark is known for its sustainable living methods, and Sweden is blessed with dramatic views. When it comes to Norway, the country is famous for its beautiful fjords and lakes. Lastly, Iceland is well known as the Land of fire because of the volcanoes and glaciers to be seen here. With so much to explore, it is important to know what to include in your Scandinavia holiday package. So, here is a list of the best places to visit in Scandinavia:- Denmark

Denmark is a land of many charms. Over the years these attractions have become apparent to a global community of travellers. The country of Denmark boasts of glorious beaches, beautiful fairytale-like castles, lush green forests, a temperate climate, and welcoming people. The country is also famous in particular for its ecologically sound practices. Last but not the least, the food here is definitely something that will keep you coming back for more. Key attractions worth visiting in the country include ( and are not limited to ) - attractions in Copenhagen like Tivoli Gardens, new Harbour, etc. If you are looking for something a bit more offbeat then do consider then LEGO House in Billund. The country of Denmark with its several attractions should definitely be considered as an inclusion to your Scandinavia travel packages from India.

Norway

Norway offers its tourists an astounding mix of cultural and natural wonders. You can visit places that are incredibly diverse ranging from the cosmopolitan city of Oslo to deep fjords. It is well said then that there is no end to choices to choose from for travellers in this fascinating country of the midnight sun and stunning northern lights. An interesting fact about Norway is that it has a museum about every aspect of its rich cultural and social history. It goes without saying that Norway is home to many spectacular sceneries, like - fjords, mountains, and glaciers. Some key places of interest in Norway are - Pulpit Rock, Lofoten Islands, Lillehammer, and so on.

Sweden

Sweden is a land that is fit to be called a traveller’s paradise. This country of rich history and varied landscapes is hard to beat.

Tourist attractions in Sweden range from luxurious and opulent palaces to quaint towns. Then there are the arctic landscapes with attractions like the famed Ice Hotel. With so much on offer, it goes without saying that a Scandinavian trip package is incomplete without Sweden as an inclusion.

Finland

Finland, sadly, is a bit of an unknown corner in Europe. This is a shame as its unspoiled natural surroundings with several cultural and historical attractions make it an ideal travel destination. This nordic playground with its lakes, rivers and vast wild areas makes it perfect for both summers and winters. There is plenty to see here, especially in Helsinki. This busy port city is home to several important museums. Additionally, it is also home to works from some of the most famous Finnish architects. We also recommend you check out the smaller cities of Turku and Porvoo in addition to exploring the countryside. As a result, Finland makes for a good addition to your Scandinavia tour packages.

Iceland

Iceland is also regarded as an island of fire and ice. It is one of the world’s top travel destinations among both thrill-seekers and nature enthusiasts. There is just so much on offer here, from geysers and glaciers to ice fields and fjords. Owing to its geographic location over one of the most seismically active areas, the residents have used this mayhem to better their lives. The surplus energy available here is used to heat residences and businesses in addition to boosting tourism.

Greece is best known for its natural beauty and fascinating culture. It is home to some of the most noteworthy historical sites, and over 6000 islands. One can spend several days exploring the archaeological marvels, cliffs that tumble into sparkling blue waters, and just so much more. From the capital of Athens to islands like Santorini, there is no dearth of places worth checking out in the fascinating land that is Greece. If you are looking for Italy and Greece vacation packages in 2022, then we suggest you check out Pickyourtrail. Pickyourtrail has an exhaustive list of travel packages. So, choose one that best suits your needs. Similarly, Italy is another fan-favourite when it comes to European travel destinations. Italy is rich in history, art, food, music, architecture, culture, and so much more. One can visit interesting attractions like temples in Sicily to soaring Dolomite mountains. Needless to say, Italy is one destination that should not be missed out on a European tour. We suggest that you hop online ASAP and start hunting out for your travel packages to Italy and Greece. Greece and Italy have had a footfall of 7.8 million and 94 million tourists respectively in recent years. With such statistics, it is safe to say that both Italy and Greece are bucket list contenders. This means that both these countries have all the perks that come with visiting a tourist hub. That unfortunately also means deciding where to spend your limited time to maximize experiences and memories. So, to help you with your worries here is a list of places worth including on your Greece and Italy tour packages:- Resting atop a rocky mound in the heart of relatively modern Athens, Acropolis is nothing lesser than a symbol. A symbol of Athens and Greece, and of Western civilization as well. It is most popular for Parthenon. Other famous attractions here include - the ancient Agora, the Roman Forum, Kerameikos, and much more. We also recommend you check out the Temple of Olympian Zeus, which is essentially a 2.5 KM walking path also referred to as the Archaeological Promenade. The historical city of Athens is a must inclusion in your Greece Italy packages. Delphi is built upon the lower slopes of Mount Parnassus. Historically, this was a sacred site as pilgrims flocked here to worship Apollo and seek advice from the mystical Oracle. One can assimilate both history and culture here, upon gazing at the ruins. We recommend you check out the numerous temples, the theatre, and a stadium that dates back from the 8th century BC to the 2nd century AD. If you fancy yourself a history buff then you should definitely check out the Delphi Archaeological Museum. The Museum has impressive collections that were discovered on the important sites in the city. This sacred and interesting site deserves a place in your Greece Italy packages from India. Ah, Santorini! No trip to Greece is complete with this, the most dramatic of Greek Isles. It is most famous for the westward located cliff-top towns of Fira and Oia. One gets the impression that these settlements are hanging over a deep, azure-hued sea-filled caldera. Tourists can expect to be greeted by Cycladic whitewashed buildings all around. Most of these have been turned into unique boutique hotels. There is plenty to do and see at Santorini like - visiting the ancient site of Akrotiri, an ancient Minoan settlement, sunbathing and swimming. The iconic Santorini should definitely be included in your Greece and Italy honeymoon packages. Mykonos is considered by quite a significant chunk of visiting tourists and population to be Greece’s most glamorous destination. It is a place chock full of chic boutique hotels, classy seafood restaurants, and several live music venues. It is frequented by celebrities as well which is partly the reason behind its glitz and glamour. We recommend you check out attractions like - Paraportiani, the whitewashed church, and the numerous beaches located here. Do consider including this glamorous location in your Italy and Greece vacation packages. Corfu is located in the Ionian Sea on the west coast off the mainland. The capital - Corfu Town has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. This status has been achieved due to the classy Italiante architecture seen here courtesy of the Venetian rule that existed here for centuries. There is plenty to see here. We recommend you explore on foot and check out the two 16th-century fortresses and arcaded Liston. We also recommend you check out the popular beach area of Paleokastritsa. Corfu makes for a great inclusion in your Greece and Italy packages from India. Rome is best known for its history and functioning as the capital of ancient Europe. To date, it remains one of the most vibrant cities anywhere on the planet. There are plenty of historical sites to take in here, ranging from - the Colosseum to the Vatican. While there is plenty to see and do here, we suggest you take a breather and enjoy the city as well. Tourists can unwind in the Borghese gardens, explore the narrow streets of Trastevere and do so much more. We guarantee you that you will keep wanting to come back for more. This is great as given all that Rome has on offer, no one can cover everything in one trip alone. The fascinating city of Rome should surely be one of the stops in your Italy and Greece trip packages. Venice is a city that thrives on its waterways and boats. It is not wrong then to say that there is a certain magic to Venice and the major attraction to the tourists is the city in itself. We recommend you check out attractions like - The basilica of St. Mark, Doge’s Palace, the Grand Canal, etc. While you may not plan on it, it is entirely possible to get lost in one of the several narrow passageways here. This is absolutely okay as Venice has postcard scenes awaiting to spring on you around every unsuspecting corner. The iconic city of Venice deserves a place in your Greece Italy tour packages. Milan may be overlooked as a travel hub, but we recommend you don’t sleep on it on your Europe getaway. After all, Milan has one of the highest concentrations of art and architectural attractions to be seen in the entire country. Additionally, it is also a paradise for design and fashion enthusiasts. The city is home to works of notable luminaries, in various fields. You can find works of Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and many more over here. We recommend you check out attractions like - II Duomo, La Scala, and much more. Lastly, if fashion is your game then do stroll through the famed Quadrilatero. This fashion and art-centric hub undoubtedly deserves a spot in your Greece and Italy packages. The Amalfi Peninsula juts sharply into the waters of the Mediterranean, just south of Naples. It forms the southern rim of Naples Bay. We don't kid when we say that it’s hard to imagine a more gorgeous or unlikely setting for the town. One is greeted with stairways as streets, beaches caught in coves of emerald waters, and flower blooms everywhere you turn your head. We recommend you check out attractions like - the Amalfi Drive, the fabled island of Capri, and Sorento while on your trip here. These coastal regions are a good addition to your Greece Italy honeymoon packages. Mt Vesuvius erupted violently back in AD 79 and engulfed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum. The city of Pompeii has since stood frozen in time for more than a millennium under six metres of ash and pumice stone. Excavations were undertaken in the 18th century which lead to the discovery of the settlement with perfectly preserved buildings and public places. A somewhat similar case is seen in the settlement of Herculaneum. However, in its case, the preservation took place due to ash. This in addition to the lava’s flow supported the existing structures. As a result, these structures are preserved in their place to date. One can marvel at the several artifacts like organic materials from the time that were preserved when the disaster struck. All in all, both these places make for an interesting visit. Peak Season: - The season of summer which lasts from July to August marks the best time to visit Greece. The temperature during these months ranges from 15 to 32°C in the north and between 21 to 33°C in the central and southern regions. These times are perfect to visit destinations like Mykonos, Santorini, Rhodes, etc. 
Shoulder Season: - If you are looking for a much more relaxed holiday to Greece, then head to the country during the Spring and Autumn seasons. These seasons last from April to June and September to October respectively. The days are long and the weather is usually mild. Speaking in terms of temperature, the mercury ranges from 5 to 29 degrees Celsius in the North and 11 to 31 degrees Celsius in the Southern and Central regions.
Low Season: - Winter Season is considered the low season in tourism in Greece. The winter season lasts from November to March. The temperatures during this season range from -3 to 15°C, northern Greece can get colder yet with an average between 7 - 20°C. While you can still head to the more well-known islands like Corfu, Rhodes, and Crete during this season, you will not be able to visit the smaller islands. If you don’t mind the relatively colder temperatures, then this still is a great time to visit Greece. Italy experiences all four seasons cyclically. The northern regions of the country can get colder than the Southern regions. This means that one should expect sub-zero temperatures during the winter seasons up north. 
Peak Season - Summers are considered to be the peak season for tourism. Summers are marked by slightly higher temperatures. The temperature during the season can range from 18 to 38 degrees Celsius. This period is marked by hot and humid weather.
Shoulder Season: - Spring is considered to be the first half of the shoulder season in Italy. The temperatures during Spring range from 5-25 degrees Celsius. The weather is generally pleasant and breezy. Autumn is considered to be the second half of the shoulder season. Autumn is marked by lower temperatures. The temperature ranges from 8 to 28 degrees Celcius during this season. The weather is pleasant and rainy.
Low Season: - Winters are considered to be the low season for tourism in Italy. Winters bring with them a drop in mercury levels. The temperature ranges from -5 to 15 degrees Celsius. The weather is dry and cold. If you are looking for stellar deals on Greece Italy honeymoon packages, then look no further than Pickyoutrail.

You will have to take trains and break in to connect to different trains to reach India. This is how you will need to travel if you are taking a train from Paris. Board the Paris-Istanbul train and board the Istanbul-Ankara at Istanbul. Next is Ankara-Tehran followed by Tehran-Zahedan, Zahedan-Quetta, Quetta-Lahore, Lahore-Amritsar and from Amritsar to Delhi. This takes about 16 days and imagine missing a train because of your previous train’s delay. Scary right? This is extremely a roundabout way to reach Paris. However the internal metro service offers frequent boarding opportunities during the day. The metro begins to operate at 5.30 am in the morning and extends its service till 12.30 am in the midnight. Hop in into your favourite metro and witness the Paris city from above while you travel to your favourite destination. Pickyourtrail offers and organises various Paris tour package for couple from India that cover the best of Paris. An astonishing 8-day Paris package built to suit your taste and travel need balances out cruise time, Eiffel time, fun ride through Disneyland and also a visit to the Palace of Versailles to behold its royalness.

Singapore has been called a "paradise for the rich," and it's undeniable that the little city-state does radiate luxury. However, Singapore has more to offer than high-end shopping malls, five-star hotels, and fine restaurants. There's also a strong history and a diverse ethnic section to explore, plus various family-friendly attractions and gorgeous public areas, making this slightly modern city enjoyable to visit. On the other side, In the entire Indonesian archipelago, Bali is one of the most fascinating places to visit. A trip here enriches the senses. In the thick tropical air, the enticing scent of incense and clove oil lingers. Traditional gamelan music wiggles against the hum of mopeds as peanuts roast at roadside kiosks, petal-strewn offerings smolder on busy sidewalks.

You can organize your Singapore Bali package from India at Pickyourtrail and get the best rates with our list of the finest places to visit in Singapore and Bali!

Siloso Beach is a great place to spend some time on the beach, with free volleyball courts, kayaking, and skimboarding available. There are various beach attractions, as well as an aquarium where you may swim with dolphins called Underwater World. Personalize your Singapore Bali package from India at Pickyourtrail and get ready to indulge in the beautiness of Singapore and Bali! Pura Tanah Lot - Pura Tanah Lot ("Pura" meaning temple in Balinese) is one of Bali's most famous temples, located 20 kilometers northwest of Kuta. The hotel's stunning beachside location, on a rocky island surrounded by rolling waves, is a significant draw. It is one of the most revered of all the island's sea temples to the Balinese people. Thousands of tourists from Kuta, Legian, and Sanur go to the temple every evening to watch the sunset behind the temple through a maze of pathways lined with souvenir vendors.
Mount Batur - Hundreds of visitors make the trip up Mount Batur's 1,700-meter top every day in the predawn darkness of Bali. They watch the sunrise above the rich patchwork of fog mountains and the valley far below as they reach the summit. This should be at the top of your list of romantic things to do in Bali for couples. This sacred active volcano is located in the Kintamani District in Bali's central highlands, approximately one hour's drive from Ubud. The hike is pretty easy and takes approximately two to three hours if done on well-marked pathways. Take your beloved with Pickyourtrail’s Singapore and Bali honeymoon packages from India to experience a romantic vacation ever!
Ubud Monkey Forest - One of the top things to do in Ubud, Bali, is to visit the Monkey Forest, also called the Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary. If you're an animal lover or a photographer, it's also one of the best spots to visit in Bali. From Ubud's town center, it takes about 10 minutes to walk here.  A significant part of the attraction is the picturesque jungle setting where the monkeys walk free, in addition to the amusing troops of grey long-tailed macaques that call this home. Book your Singapore and Bali tour package from Pickyourtrail and grab the early bird offer!
Pura Ulun Danu Bratan - Pura Ulun Danu Bratan, built in the 17th century, is one of Bali's most beautiful temple complexes. It is located on a small island off the western edge of Lake Bratan in the chilly central Bali highlands. The tented temples reflect on the lake, and when the water levels rise, they appear to float on the surface, set against the majestic backdrop of Gunung Bratan. The temple complex is devoted to Dewi Danu, goddess of the sea and lakes, and is one of Bali's principal sources of irrigation and drinking water.
Nusa Dua Beach - Want to get away from the hustle and bustle of Bali's city life? The solution is Nusa Dua Beach. Listen to the soft slope of surf on silky, white sands while relaxing on a comfortable sun lounger with a refreshing drink in hand. You won't get the cultural experience you'd receive anywhere in Bali - after all, this is a gated resort enclave on its private peninsula – but if solitude and reasonably clean sands are what you're looking for, you'll find it here, at one of Bali's best beaches. Though Singapore is a year-round location, the months of December to June are ideal for visiting. The dry season in Singapore runs from February to April, and this is when the country experiences the lowest amount of rain, the least humidity, and the most sun. Singapore's weather is pretty constant and pleasant enough for tourists to visit all year. The best time to visit Singapore is from July to November if you want to escape the crowds. The dry season in Bali, which runs from April to October, is the greatest time to visit. Even though the weather is pleasant for visitors, the island has wet, humid days throughout the year. In the middle of the season, many stores have sales and promotions, and restaurants are less crowded. You'll be greeted by abundant rain showers, cloudy sky, and dense clouds, all of which are ready to let go of the rain. The island is subjected to blowing gusts of wind between June and August. Singapore, a place of futuristic wonders and sky-kissing towers, is much ahead of its time. It almost feels like the stars have landed on earth with the magnificently lighted lights that move around at night, showcasing its futuristic buildings. Singapore is noted for its rapid growth, stunning and modern retail complexes, beautiful dining establishments, and opulent hotels with breathtaking vistas. Meanwhile, Thousands of Hindu temples strewn across the island have earned Bali the name of 'Island of the Gods.' However, this is merely a small sample of Bali's attractions. The humid tropical environment laden with the perfume of spices and rain, and also the sight of vegetation, strikes the senses like intoxication the moment one steps foot in Bali. Bali sightseeing has become quite a craze, and justifiably so, thanks to the ever-growing South Asian tourism and the bestselling book/movie Eat, Pray, Love. Add this list of the top 5 locations to visit in Singapore and Bali with Pickyourtrail’s Singapore Bali tour package and get ready to experience the most fantastic vacation ever!

Bali is rich in natural beauty and has attractions for every type of traveller, despite the loudness and mayhem of the main tourist destinations. Surfers travel here for the renowned swells, hikers ascend jungly volcanic peaks to misty waterfalls, and cyclists can ride through verdant regions. This sough-after destination is studded with ancient towns and rice terraces. Thailand is by far the most popular of all the South Asian countries that travellers from across the world love to visit. Thailand, sometimes known as the Land of Smiles, is a developed country that offers a wide range of contemporary conveniences. Although the country still remaining undeveloped enough to enable adventures and once-in-a-lifetime travel opportunities. Thailand has several tourist destinations that are more than deserving of being on a bucket list. Let us now look at some of the best places in both these locations to help you book your dream Singapore package, Malaysia package and Bali tour package: Located in Tegenungan hamlet, midway between Ubud and Denpasar, Tegenungan Waterfall, is one of the most well-liked picnic sites in the area. It is situated in a small swimming area surrounded by thick vegetation and a row of cafés and restaurants. The area, being both remote and removed from the rest of Bali, is perfect for wildlife photographers. The waterfall has numerous levels, each of which may be accessed by a set of steps. Swimming in the shallow pool bed is one of the main things to do here. Due to its popularity and ease of access, this waterfall is often crowded. Even so, the drive here is pleasant and the location is excellent for a quick picnic away from Bali. Mount Batur, also known as Gunung Batur in the local tongue, is an active volcano in Indonesia. At 1717 metres (about 5,600 feet) above sea level, it provides a breathtaking perspective of its surroundings - including the magnificent Lake Batur. The region is surrounded by black lava from the most recent eruption in 2000. We suggest that tourists start the walk at three in the morning to see the sun rise over the horizon. As the climb is not too difficult, it is a good option for all kinds of tourists. Needless to say, Mount Batur is a great addition to your Malaysia and Bali package. As its name implies, Bali's Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary is a 12.5-hectare expanse of virgin woodland home to a large population of amiable monkeys. This sanctuary, also known as the Ubud Monkey Forest, is run by Mandala Suci Wenara Wana Management. It is owned by the Pandangetal community. Every year, flocks of tourists throng to this sanctuary to see the amazing spectacle of numerous monkeys swinging from tree to tree. The Holy Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud provides a natural habitat for around 600 Balinese long-tailed monkeys. One can get up close and personal with them. Notably, this attraction is also popular because of it’s spiritual and ecological significance. With over 115 different tree types and a large number of monkeys foraging for food from tourists, this is a wonderful place for those who enjoy culture and the outdoors. We recommend you add this forest sanctuary to your Malaysia and Bali tour package right away! Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, or KL is spread over an area of over 245 sq km. Being the biggest city in Malaysia and officially a Federal Territory, it is known for its steel-clad skyscrapers, enormous malls, prominent landmarks, lively markets, and developing nightlife. There are several districts in Kuala Lumpur, each with a unique reputation. The Golden Triangle, which includes the neighbourhoods of Bukit Bintang, KLCC, and Chinatown, is the city's biggest tourist attraction. They are known as the city's entertainment centre and are where some of the hottest nightclubs, lounges, and bars can be found. It is not surprising that Kuala Lumpur is frequently referred to as the retail and fashion centre of Southeast Asia. This title can be explained by the fact that it is home to three of the ten largest shopping malls in the world! Langkawi, often known as the Jewel of Kedah State, is an archipelago of 99 islands in Malaysia. This hotly travelled destination draws more than 3 million tourists a year. Spread over the clear Malacca Strait, it is home to calm beaches dotted with cliffs and rainforests, vast rice farms, and stylish promenades to name a few.

Tanjung Rhu and Pantai Cenang Beach are popular locations for snorkelling, as are Pulau Payar Marine Park and diving. Gunung Raya, the tallest hill in the area has a golf course at its base. Adventure enthusiasts should look into - Skytrail Jungle, home to 500-year-old flora, and the Langkawi Wildlife Park. These are all well-liked trekking locations. Visitors also adore strolling on the glass bridge that circles the Telaga Tujuh Waterfalls at a height of 2,300 feet. This destination is an excellent addition to your Singapore Malaysia Bali tour package. Genting Highlands is a stunning hill resort in Malaysia. It is easily accessible from Kuala Lumpur through a one-hour car journey. Situated in the Pahang province. The City of Entertainment is known for its vibrant nightlife, five-star hotels, sizable retail centres, and top-notch casinos.

In addition to cave temples, amusement parks, and a water park, Genting is the only location in Malaysia where gambling is permitted.

Bali seems to offer it all. It has locations that seem unaffected by time, despite the fact that several areas there have recently suffered from overcommercialization. As a result, every traveler stands to find just a little piece of paradise in Bali. So, whether you choose to learn more about the unique culture of the Balinese people, or go scuba diving in coral reefs? You will end up with a fulfilling experience either way. Here, we take a look at some of the best places to visit in Vietnam and Bali to help you with booking your Bali tour package and Vietnam tour package. Let's get started! Romantic 8 Nights Bali and Vietnam Honeymoon Packages 9 Days/8 Nights Rs. 65,513 (Hotels, Activities, Transfers) Uluwatu is a popular surfing destination located at the southwesterly tip of Bukit that draws surfers of all skill levels to its thrilling beachfront. The waves consist of five top-notch surf breaks. One can also enjoy from the hotels and eateries that look out to the Indian Ocean and provide stunning views. However, this place is not just for the adventure enthusiast. We can say so as the Pura Luru Uluwatu temple is a significant cultural attraction nearby. With extensive attractions on offer, Uluwatu should definitely be added to your Vietnam Bali package. Located in Bedugul, west of Lake Bratan, Pura Ulun Danu Bratan is a 17th-century temple honouring the Hindu trinity of Brahma-Vishnu-Shiva. The temple is built in the typical Balinese style with tiered shrines to honour the Hindu gods. This stunning place of worship has the Bedugul mountains as its backdrop. Being situated next to Lake Beratan, the tranquil waters of the lake mirror it to result in a mesmerising floating scenery. We recommend that you hire a boat here and take a tour of the lake while admiring the magnificent view of the temple. Located on the route to Kintamani, the Tegallalang Rice Terraces are a well-liked stop. These fields are also located approximately 20 minutes north of Ubud in Bali and are well-known for their breathtaking setting. The two swings where one may take pictures are one of the major draws here. The location looks particularly breathtaking during dawn and dusk. The atmosphere here is extremely pleasant thanks to fresh winds and nice weather to complement the picturesque view. The valley's ageless appeal compliments the area's vibrant culture. Like any other appealing attraction in Bali, there is plenty to do here! One can click some beautiful pictures, enjoy a cup of coffee at one of the cute tiny cafés, and much more. We suggest you make some time for the adjacent Pakudui hamlet to look at the elaborate woodwork crafts. We highly recommend that you add these rice fields to your Vietnam Bali tours. Halong Bay has long been recognised as a unique destination. This can be best understood by the fact that a section of the region received the designation of a World Heritage Site in 1994. Fast forward to the modern day and Halong Bay's ethereal splendour is a sight to behold. This destination is well known for little islands of varied sizes and forms surrounded by clear blue seas and towering karst limestone pillars. Situated in northern Vietnam, it is the most visited tourist destination on this side of the country. The principal entrance to the waters is through Halong City. A cruise or day trip boat is the most popular method of viewing the area, where visitors lounge on the boats while they pass by limestone pillars and a variety of islands. An island drop-off and cave investigations are common additions to cruises and day outings. Moreover, there are some floating communities where guests are welcome to stop by! We suggest you take your time and meet the residents, sample their cuisine, and purchase trinkets. Another pastime that has grown significantly in popularity over the past several years is kayaking. On a beautiful sunny day, one may kayak close to and around the limestone pillars. Some caverns also permit kayak exploration, which is a thrilling experience. In conclusion, Halong Bay should be a mandatory inclusion in your Bali Vietnam Tour Package. Perched on the banks of the Red River - Hanoi is the capital of Vietnam. It is one of the oldest cities in the world and therefore has a noteworthy past. Hanoi is a fusion of French, Chinese, and Southeast Asian cultures, with well-preserved colonial buildings, golden pagodas, distinctive museums. One can enjoy delectable cuisine, entertainment options, and traditional bazaars on their visit here. The most amazing site of historical and cultural importance in Hanoi is the Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum, where remains of rulers of yesteryear are interred. Additionally, Perfume Pagoda, and Hoa Lo Prison Relic, which are both on the UNESCO World Heritage List are worth visiting as well. The Old Quarter and French Quarter are culturally rich albeit mysterious regions filled with courtyards and buildings designed in the Parisian style. If you get saturated by all these attractions then a break from the monotony of the city may be found at Bach Ma Temple, Tran Quoc Pagoda, and so on. Do not forget to add Hanoi to your Vietnam Bali package! Located in central Vietnam, Hoi An, is a village and also one of the oldest ones in Asia. It was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999. Hoi An, which is south of Danang, means a calm gathering spot. It is one of the richest and most significant towns in Vietnam in terms of both heritage and culture. It is worth noting here that Hoi An can only be accessible by road and lacks an airport or railway station . Thankfully, other things make up for this glaring negative. To start with, Hoi An's cuisine is deliciously unique and multicultural because it is a commercial port. Traditional regional food is on offer here too, however, it is seen to be served with influences from Eastern Asia and other Southeast Asian countries. It is no wonder then that cooking is extremely popular here. This means that cooking workshops, where visitors can try their hand at making some traditional meals, are a common tourist activity in this area. We are sure you must be raring to set off to both Vietnam and Bali by now. So, head on over to PickYourTrail to book an economical and customisable travel package to these amazing travel destinations. Happy travels!

The most fundamental need in life is to break monotony from time to time, and vacations are a perfect way to do just that. A holiday in Vietnam in particular promises to be soothing and serves as a way to refuel your senses. This nation provides tourists with a broad selection of activities thanks to its Buddhist temples, tranquil hill villages, and enormous caverns. Cambodia is no different. You will be completely amazed by the combination of the ancient and the new here. Whether you're in the smart and modern city of Cambodia, Phnom Penh, or the famous Angkor temples, the country never fails to amaze. Bordered by Vietnam to the east and Thailand to the northwest, Cambodia is a place of elusive animals and exotic experiences. Let's take a closer look at some of the best places to visit in Vietnam and Cambodia to help you book your Vietnam Cambodia tour package. Explore the rich cultural tapestry and breathtaking landscapes of Vietnam with our exclusive Vietnam tour package, designed to offer you an immersive and unforgettable travel experience. Ho Chi Minh City or Saigon is the largest metropolis and the financial and cultural centre of southern Vietnam. The city is a bustling metropolis with strong cultural ties that have swiftly adjusted to the pressures of urbanisation. In this area, one can find magnificent temples and ancient shrines of many religions coexisting with soaring skyscrapers and retail centres. The busiest airport in the nation, Tan Son Nhat International Airport, serves Ho Chi Minh City which makes this a good starting point for your trip. A look at the city's history and it immediately becomes evident that Ho Chi Minh City has come a long way since the Vietnam War. The city has progressed from heights of unrest, to become probably the most famous tourist attraction in the nation. There are several historical landmarks left behind from its turbulent past, including the Cu Chi and Ben Dinh Tunnels. Other notable locations include the Notre Dame Cathedral, Saigon Opera House, and Central Post Office. All these impressive landmarks wonderfully display traditional French architecture and were constructed while France ruled the region. District 1 of the city is home to several well-known tourist attractions, which are all near to one another. This is one destination you should definitely include in your Vietnam Cambodia package. Embark on a captivating journey through ancient temples, vibrant markets, and scenic wonders with our meticulously curated Cambodia packages, ensuring a seamless and enchanting adventure for every traveler. Nha Trang, a well-known beach resort city on the southern central coast of Vietnam, is home to some of the world's most picturesque bays. While the shoreline's exquisite powdery white crescent beach is its most notable feature, frequent renovations have led to the creation of parks etc. Furthermore, there are sculpture gardens, vibrant promenades, and opulent resorts directly on the beach. Due to the great weather, activities like sailing, kiteboarding, and scuba diving are fairly popular here all year round. Both luxury travellers and backpackers like Nha Trang. The area screams tropical paradise with little stores, spas, and cocktail bars that may be found on the streets running down the coast. Additionally, some of the greatest seafood in Vietnam is served at these small restaurants and food stands. We recommend you try the pulled pork summer rolls as it is a perennial favourite. In the evenings, locals and visitors transition to raucous partying in the pavement pubs and clubs till dawn. Nha Trang is a regular on most Vietnam Cambodia packages from India. Located at the centre of Quang Binh province in North Central Vietnam, Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park is another UNESCO World Heritage site. Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park is well-known for its many cave networks and ancient karst mountains. Tourists can enjoy lush green forests and shimmering subterranean rivers on their visit here. The national park's 10,000 hectares, which are largely covered in deep forests, make it an exciting place to visit if you want to see a wide variety of plants and animals. This flora and fauna has been preserved in an environment of prehistoric limestone formations. Several sizable karst mountains make this a haven for adventurers, nature enthusiasts, and thrill seekers. It is worth noting that many of the hundreds of caves and caverns in the diverse range of intriguing limestone mountains have yet to be investigated. This should make exploration here a fun-filled activity. Thrill seekers can also indulge in a variety of adrenaline-pumping sports, including hiking, mountain climbing, kayaking, and canoeing. Siem Reap is a shining example of bygone splendour and ageless majesty. Having a population of roughly 8500, Siem Reap is mostly used by tourists as a jumping-off place to see the Angkor Archaeological Park and other temple ruins. Megastructures like this are unique and unique in their own right. These locations always leave explorers in awe of the strange architectural methods employed to build the temples. Siam Reap is also known for serving as the entrance to Angkor Wat, one of the most amazing structures in human history. Although its close access to multiple ancient temples is the primary reason to stay in Siem Reap; the city itself offers a pleasant surprise of historical and contemporary fusions. The capital of Cambodia is Phnom Penh. The splendour of the ancient Khmer civilization, the regrettable recent past, and a promising future can all be encountered in this ever-expanding metropolis. Phnom Penh inherits a magnificent fusion of Khmer and French architectural grandeur as it sits at the confluence of the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers. The city's bustling marketplaces, regal structures, flourishing pubs, and sensual local cuisine scenes are among its key draws. Phnom Penh should definitely be included in your Vietnam Cambodia package. The tranquil and charming beach town of Kep is located in the southern region of Cambodia. The Gulf of Thailand can be seen from its southern side. While Kep is not a particularly lively seaside town, it is chockful of history, tranquillity, and some truly breathtaking landscapes. This stunning location is home to practically every shade of green and blue in its trees and tranquil waterways.

Vietnam is incredibly diversified in terms of both its natural beauty and cultural diversity. Travelers can experience a wealth of cultural heritage in Vietnam owing to its lengthy history and multicultural population, which comprises more than 50 ethnic minority groups. The landscape includes beautiful paddy fields painted in each and every shade of green imaginable, as well as craggy peaks seen from twisting mountain routes. Halong Bay, Vietnam's most well-known natural tourist destination, allows visitors to see nature up close. At national parks, hiking, biking, and kayaking are common pastimes, this means that outdoor enthusiasts are covered too! Let's talk a bit about Singapore now. The little city-state of Singapore has often been regarded as a playground for the wealthy. While that is is true; Singapore has more to offer than upscale shopping centres, five-star hotels, and exquisite restaurants. In addition, there are numerous family-friendly activities and beautiful public spaces that make exploring this futuristic city worthwhile. There is also a rich history and several varied ethnic neighbourhoods waiting to be uncovered. Read on to find out more about the best travel locations in both these countries. This will help you book your Vietnam Singapore holiday package with ease! Between Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, on Vietnam's east coast, is a charming city called Da Nang. Da Nang is sometimes referred to as the tourism centre of South-Central Vietnam. It is a truly stunning, magnificent city with top-notch infrastructure, beaches, museums, and a developing nightlife. Being a city on the South China Sea coast with the Han River running through it, there are numerous attractive bridges here. The Golden Bridge, which is embellished with a sculpture of two enormous hands supporting it, is undoubtedly the most outstanding of the lot. Moving on, the Marble Mountains, five mysterious natural limestone marble peaks holding caverns etc are other well-known sights in the city. Additionally, Bach Ma National Park, Son Tra Mountain, which rises to a height of 693 metres, and the Ba Na Hills are all popular trekking destinations. Devotees often frequent Phap Lam Pagoda and the 67-meter-tall Buddha Shakyamuni statue in Linh Ung Pagoda. Lastly, My Khe Beach, Pham van Dong Beach, Han River, and Thanh Binh Beach are the ideal tranquil retreats for seafood, surfing, and kayaking. With astounding variety of options to choose from, do not forget to include this destination in your Vietnam Singapore holiday package. Phu Quoc Island is perhaps best known for being the largest island in Vietnam. It is home to some of the most breathtaking white sand beaches that are lined with palm and coconut palms. It makes for an ideal location for a long weekend escape because it is only 45 kilometres from Vietnam's southernmost point. Additionally, it is only 4 kilometres from Cambodia. Travellers can rejoice, as regardless of one's nationality, you are not required to get a visa if you arrive by direct flight from another country. However, if you are travelling by boat from Vietnam to visit the island, you will require a valid Vietnam visa. Once here you can have your pick among hundreds of resorts. A majority of these have private beaches and other amenities that guarantee your utmost relaxation. If you are in the mood to explore then all you need to do is rent a bike and you will be on your way to discover the island's best offerings! It is worth noting that this is one of the few locations in Vietnam where gambling is legally permitted. We suggest that you definitely consider Phu Quoc as an addition to your Vietnam Singapore trip. The city of Ninh Binh and its neighbouring areas are a nature lover's dream. A vacation here offers rich natural landscapes and a variety of historical sites. It is one of the oldest places in Vietnam and serves as the capital of the province of the same name. Halong Bay is thought of as its sister location. Primarily, it serves largely as a staging area, and opens up access to several remote destinations. These include Tam Coc, Van Long Natural Reserve, and neighbouring Trang An. Although it lacks an airport of its own, the city may be accessed by train most effectively because of the high frequency. The scenery of Ninh Binh is dominated by many colours of green, which makes this a hotspot of ecological variety. Overall, the location is breathtaking - surrounded by mountains, caverns, and wonderfully attractive limestone scenery. The Cuc Phuong National Park, one of the province's major protected areas, is another magnificent natural destination. Including Ninh Binh on your Vietnam Singapore trip will elevate it to another level entirely! The futuristic botanical gardens -  Gardens by the Bay  are located in the heart of Singapore. These are home to futuristic Supertrees groves, high-tech space domes, and bizarre sculptures. Gardens by the Bay is home to around 400,000 plants and is renowned for its breathtaking modern architecture. Visitors should not sleep on the mesmerising Garden Rhapsody light and music display. These park conservatories are both vast and colourful and spread across 250 acres of reclaimed land along the waterfront. Its famous Supertree structures, which are futuristic botanical giants connected by a commanding Skyway, offer a mesmerizing view as one traverses the skywalk over the gardens. The oversized seashell-shaped greenhouse of Gardens by the Bay called the Flower Dome makes for an interesting attraction in itself. What's interesting here is that it is the largest glass greenhouse on the planet that perfectly mimics chilly mountain climates. Sentosa Island is a small resort island off the southern coast of Singapore. The island is home to parks, sun-kissed beaches, beautiful jungles, amazing spas, and much more. Sentosa Island is crammed with tourist attractions, including amusement parks, a stunning aquarium (Underwater World), and beach clubs with vibrant music. The list goes on and is not limited to attractions like an ethnic village, and the island's main feature - a massive Merlion Statue. Additionally - Fort Siloso, the sole intact fort in Singapore, is situated on Sentosa Island. This is not all as those seeking tranquillity at the beach can head to Siloso Beach. The location is easily accessible by taxi, bus, cable car, or even through the Sentosa Express which costs just a nominal SGD $4.

So, we are here to help you better plan your travels and book your dream Vietnam and Thailand holiday package. Let's get going Travelling to the southwest highlands of Vietnam, about 6 hours from Ho Chi Minh City, will take you to the cool hill station of Da Lat. Because of its distinctively temperate temperature, it is the capital of Lam Dong Province and is referred to as the City of Endless Spring. Da Lat's crisp and chilly climate draws honeymooners, trekkers, as well as luxury travellers. Being surrounded by pine trees, high hills, blooming flowers, and a top-notch golf course, it is also sometimes referred to as Little Paris. This environment and climate here is a far cry from the tropical heat of the south. The most noticeable aspect of Da Lat is its pervasive, breathtaking French colonial architecture. It can be seen abundantly in places like Emperor Bao Dai's Summer Palace, the French Quarter, and Dalat Palace Golf Club. Hue is one of the oldest towns in Vietnam. It is interestingly, the ancient royal capital of the Nguyen dynasty in central Vietnam. This is a predominantly historical city, located on the banks of the Perfume River. It is famed for housing the Imperial City, which served as the royal family's centre of power. Like many other locations in the country, this was also designated a World Heritage Site in 1993. Hue has developed as a destination for travellers on a tight budget in recent years. The Backpacker zone, which includes Pham Ngu Lao, Vo Thi Sau Street, and Chu Van An, is home to several hotels, pubs, and eateries. We highly recommend that tourists explore the many buildings, temples and constructs of the Royal Empire. Tu Hien Pagoda and Thien Mu Pagoda, are particularly notable among these historical attractions. The latter is regarded as the official symbol of Hue. Moving on, there are several buildings along the Perfume River that were built during the French rule. All these showcase French architecture in its most elegant form. Hue should definitely be included in your Thailand and Vietnam holiday packages. Sapa is a town from the colonial era in northwest Vietnam. It is perched above the Hoang Lien Son Mountains and provides views of the Muong Hoa Valley's rice terraces. At a height of 1,500 metres, this little market town provides some of the greatest trekking spots in Vietnam and shares a border with China. Sapa is quickly gaining popularity as a tourist destination since it perhaps offers the most genuine bucolic experience in the entire nation. The top spots to hit are - Dragon Jaw Mountain and Heaven's Gate. These include vibrant flowerbeds, waterfalls, tropical greenery, natural rock formations, and man-made stone monuments. These two make up Sapa's finest hiking locations. If you don't want to hike, Fansipan's cable car rides provide sweeping vistas of the rice terraces. Bangkok, Thailand's capital is a metropolis that never sleeps. This land is a contemporary mash-up of diverse cultures and religions. Temples and monasteries exist harmoniously here in close proximity to imposing skyscrapers. Retail therapy can be enjoyed at both street bazaars, floating markets as well as upscale malls and retail centres. Thai and international cuisines are shown in all their glory both at the streets and at rooftop highend eateries. On the one side, Bangkok's nightlife is centred on glitzy nightclubs, rooftop and go-go bars, vibrant neon light signs, and inexpensive cocktails. On the other hand, it also offers peaceful and intriguing cabaret performances, Muay Thai and dance displays. Attractions like the Grand Palace, Wat Pho, and Wat Phra Kaew highlight the city's extensive history, while attractions like Art in Paradise and Sea Life Ocean World appeal to those looking for more contemporary experiences. With more offerings than one can possibly imagine, Bangkok makes for a good addition to your Thailand and Vietnam tour packages. Phuket, Thailand's biggest island, provides the best that the country has to offer. It is situated on the Andaman Sea coast in southern Thailand. This destination's true fandom can be fathomed from the fact that it never lacks visitors throughout the year. Phuket is best described as having a high-octane nightlife, many outlying islands, vibrant marketplaces, and exhilarating water sports. It is also one of Thailand's top beach locations with the quickest access. Both, families and eccentric tasted travellers are catered to at beaches like Surin and Kata. On the other side, Patong Beach continues to serve people who prefer it cheap, loud, and wild once the sun sets. As night falls, Bangla Road, with its many pubs and food carts, comes alive. Those who want to avoid blinding lights and loud settings can head to Cabaret performances or even the ever-favourite street markets. Travellers can lose track of time here while perusing a variety of clothing, trinkets, and souvenirs at the Phuket Walking Street or Phuket Weekend markets. Six islands form the  Phi Phi  group of islands. The two most well-known islands of the lot of six are Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Leh. These are both about 40 kilometres from Phuket. Both these islands are great places to spend a couple of days in Thailand because of their clear seas and the lively lifestyle of the locals. Together with the larger islands, Phi Phi also has four smaller islands that go by the names of Bida Nok, Bida Nai, Ko Mai Phai, and Bamboo Island. With the 2000 Hollywood film The Beach, which was filmed in Ko Phi Phi Le, the Phi Phi Islands gained notoriety. With its towering cliffs, white sand beaches, surrounding vegetation, and crystal-clear seas, it appears to be nothing short of heaven. Thanks to little interference, the Phi Phi Islands are one of the few remaining unspoiled natural settings in the world.

Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended departure date. Spain uses the Euro (EUR), while Greece also uses the Euro (EUR).
It's a good idea to carry some local currency for small expenses, although credit cards are widely accepted. Check the weather for your travel dates and pack accordingly.
Both Spain and Greece can have warm summers and cooler winters, so pack layers. Consider purchasing travel insurance to cover unexpected events, such as trip cancellations or medical emergencies. Spanish is the official language in Spain, and Greek is spoken in Greece.
Learning a few basic phrases in the local languages can enhance your travel experience. Both Spain and Greece use European-style two-pin plugs. Ensure you have the necessary adapters for your electronic devices. Check if any vaccinations or health precautions are necessary before your trip. Have copies of important travel documents, such as your passport, stored separately from the originals.
Make a checklist of essential items to pack, including travel guides, maps, and language phrasebooks. Your journey to Spain and Greece promises to be an extraordinary fusion of culture, history, and natural beauty. Our tour packages are designed to make this adventure seamless and unforgettable.

Pickyourtrail is not liable to refund a customer who is not allowed to board the flight because of invalid passports (validity expired, damaged passports). Customers are expected to reach the airport ahead of their boarding time (at least 2 hours prior to boarding time). Pickyourtrail is not responsible to refund customers (for cases wherein airport transfers are not planned by us) who miss their flights owing to delayed arrival at the airport. For cases wherein airport transfers are planned by Pickyourtrail, flight cancellations due to delayed transfers owing to unforeseen circumstances specific to a region will not be borne by Pickyourtrail. Details about baggage limitations (cabin and check-in) will be furnished as part of the final travel vouchers. Additional costs owing to breached baggage limits will have to be paid by the customer at the time of check-in. Certain flight carriers (LCC like Ryanair, Vueling, Voltea etc.) have a mandatory web check-in policy. Failure to comply with this could result in an additional cost to be paid at the airport. Pickyourtrail is not liable to refund customers in such circumstances. Pickyourtrail will set meal preferences for customers with airline carriers upon request. However, Pickyourtrail has no control over the availability and quality of meals served on the flight. This will be controlled completely by the airline carrier.

While Pickyourtrail strives to provide the best hotels with world-class amenities, we cannot be held responsible for factors such as hotel staff behaviour, cleanliness and quality of accommodation. Additional costs owing to on-trip room upgrades and additional amenities will be borne by the customer. All hotels changed on-trip (Hotels booked per itinerary cancelled and new hotels booked) will entail a 100% cancellation fee. Entertaining early check-in or late check-out requests is solely based on the discretion of the hotel.

We will guide customers on Visa formalities & Visa documentation for specific destinations. The discretion to grant/reject Visa rests solely with the concerned embassy and Pickyourtrail will not be responsible for rejection of any applications. The visa fee is non-refundable in case of rejected visa applications. While we strive to provide a seamless Visa experience to the customers, Pickyourtrail will not be held responsible for unforeseen changes to Visa formalities levied by the embassy during the document submission and processing phase.
