The foundation will help us give equal opportunity to children and create a better world for our children. - Sachin Tendulkar I feel blessed. As a child, I was surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped me achieve my dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for our nation. The tremendous support I received over the years from all has made me who I am. In my second innings, I want to give back to the nation which I served proudly. We often speak about making the world a better place for our children. By focussing on children’s health, education and sports – we can create a positive difference to their present and future. The Foundation is a step in continuing my contribution to society. By working together, we can create a difference. Let’s nurture a billion dreams and let our youth excel. - Sachin Tendulkar The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation works with institutions and municipal hospitals that provide quality healthcare at affordable costs to underprivileged children. We focus on nutrition, preventative measures and work to improve access to healthcare for children. If dreams do not discriminate, then why should we? Every child is important and should have the opportunity and the right to receive a good quality education. The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation aims to work with partners who help children who come from underprivileged sections of society, and help them chase their dreams. Sport does not differentiate once we enter the arena. It’s a level-playing field that allows everyone to flourish and prepares the individuals for various life skills. Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. Through Ekam Foundation Mumbai, we endeavour to provide financial assistance for child healthcare to underprivileged sections of society, in government and trust hospitals. Through a basketball excellence program called ‘Hope through Hoops’, underprivileged girls and boys in tribal areas of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Gujarat are taught life lessons through sport. Children develop character, confidence and team spirit that help them to excel in life. Inga Health Foundation aims at treating children who are born with cleft and craniofacial deformities. Through Inga, we sponsor treatment for the financially underprivileged. We aspire to put a smile on the faces of children and wish for them to have a normal life like everyone else. Makunda Hospital is located in a remote tribal region of Assam. By donating essential medical equipment and funding needy children, we help provide quality healthcare to patients from Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Parivaar works towards the overall development of underprivileged children in tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh. We aim to address issues such as nutrition and quality education, by helping build a school and providing nutritious meals and a holistic complementary education programme. SRCC Children’s Hospital combines paediatric medical experience with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure affordable, quality medical care for children.We have partnered with them to cater to poor families who can’t always afford appropriate medical care. We wish to ease their financial burden so that critical care can continue where required. Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) works towards providing financial assistance and mentoring support to students from the underprivileged sections of society, to pursue higher education. We enable these children to chase their dreams by funding their education. With Shreeja's “Football & Beyond” initiative, we empower young girls through sports-based development programs in tribal areas of Kolkata, West Bengal. We aspire to inculcate life-skills needed to bring marginalised sections into mainstream society. Work across India to create Impact We commit to conducting operations in a transparent manner - conforming to the highest ethical and moral standards. We comply with the law of the land in all countries that we operate in or choose to operate in. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and do not engage, encourage or transact with individuals or institutions who don’t comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) India. We refrain from carrying out any activity which may prove to be detrimental to people and communities. In all regions we operate in or communities we work with, we display culturally appropriate behaviour. We work with partners who abide by the law of the land. We do not discriminate our stakeholders based on religion, caste, creed, sex, race/nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation or political beliefs. We treat all our stakeholders with dignity and respect. We respect the confidentiality policy of our stakeholders and commit to upholding the same unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties. We would expect the same from our stakeholders/partners towards our confidentiality. We have been partnering with the Sachin Tendulkar foundation since the last two years. It has been a fruitful experience working with the foundation. It all started with a generous grant from the foundation through which we could expand our Neonatal Intensive Care Services. Last year, we were privileged to start the ROP screening services for the premature babies in our NICU. In addition to this, the foundation has been supporting a lot of children who come from poor socio economic strata, with their hospital expenses. We are grateful to the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all support and we wish them the best in the coming year. We highly value the support that we are receiving from Shri Sachin Tendulkar and his Foundation. We are overwhelmed by the magnanimity and the high empathy that their entire team shows with Parivaar's mission and practical constraints. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is one of our long standing partner of Ekam Foundation Mumbai. Our partnership has been of defined by respect and transparency and above all working together for the better of children healthcare solutions. As part of our partnership there is continuous challenge and opportunity to explore newer frontiers with greater impact. We are proud to be associated with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation over the last few years on the Hi 5 basketball excellence program for tribal children in Mumbai/ Kolkata. The SRT team is extremely professional and compassionate in structuring and supporting all aspects of the program – namely the children, coaches and basketball infrastructure. Anjali and Sachin are both personally involved and committed to sports, tribal children and girls. Their personal involvement and interaction with the tribal children and our team inspires us all to greater heights. We are looking forward to working together for many more years in taking these children to greater heights in sports and in life! Inga Health Foundation carries a privilege of working with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation in its endeavor to provide treatment to deformed kids. While IHF carries the support of several donors, Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been proactive, in understanding the foundation and its efforts, on a regular basis. Interactions with the team, and more specifically Dr.Anjali Tendulkar, provides the foundation a much needed assessment of its work, and, a platform to improvise its service and objectives. Dr Anjali Tendulkar, being a medical professional, has taken significant interest in understanding the foundation, and her participation in the meeting, has been highly rewarding. We on behalf of Inga Health Foundation, are truly privileged to work alongside with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, treating children born with birth deformities of the skull and face, free of cost. Our job is that much easier to communicate with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, as Dr.Anjali Tendulkar is herself an eminent pediatrician . Her deep understanding of the nature of deformities, allows us to communicate and collaborate to high professional standards. I thank Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all the support. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the very esteemed Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for giving us an opportunity to collaborate and work with them . It has taken our organization to a different league. It has personally made me feel 10 folds more confident in the work Inga Health Foundation offers to mankind, and, has made me and our surgical team feel proud of the work we do. In simple words " We Must Be doing Something Right " to be under the agesis of Sachin Tendulkar Foundation and deserve their benevolence. Was humbled when Dr.Anjali Tendulkar herself participated in our very first meeting, to understand about Inga Health foundation and its activities. One of the finest gestures i have ever witnessed till date. Truly obliged and privileged. Once the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation team was convinced about our credentials, they have very actively and enthusiastically supported our initiative. We together have been able to scale up the positive impact on the lives of most deserving students in fulfilling their higher education dreams and helping their families in coming out of a poverty trap. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been supporting poor and needy patients at the SRCC Children’s Hospital for several years. We have utilised these generous funds for critically ill children who have had catastrophic and sudden onset of very serious illness. Parents are unprepared for the enormous financial burden of modern medicine and the combined stress of illness and finance is usually overwhelming. The funds from STF go a long way in alleviating some of this burden. Over a hundred children with complex problems and advanced surgical interventions have benefitted from the generosity of the foundation. We, at the SRCC Children’s hospital are ever grateful for the continuing support of Anjali and Sachin Tendulkar.

The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation was created to give a platform to bring together people, institutions and resources who are passionate about bringing a social change. The foundation will help us give equal opportunity to children and create a better world for our children. - Sachin Tendulkar I feel blessed. As a child, I was surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped me achieve my dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for our nation. The tremendous support I received over the years from all has made me who I am. In my second innings, I want to give back to the nation which I served proudly. We often speak about making the world a better place for our children. By focussing on children’s health, education and sports – we can create a positive difference to their present and future. The Foundation is a step in continuing my contribution to society. By working together, we can create a difference. Let’s nurture a billion dreams and let our youth excel. - Sachin Tendulkar The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation works with institutions and municipal hospitals that provide quality healthcare at affordable costs to underprivileged children. We focus on nutrition, preventative measures and work to improve access to healthcare for children. If dreams do not discriminate, then why should we? Every child is important and should have the opportunity and the right to receive a good quality education. The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation aims to work with partners who help children who come from underprivileged sections of society, and help them chase their dreams. Sport does not differentiate once we enter the arena. It’s a level-playing field that allows everyone to flourish and prepares the individuals for various life skills. Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. Through Ekam Foundation Mumbai, we endeavour to provide financial assistance for child healthcare to underprivileged sections of society, in government and trust hospitals. Through a basketball excellence program called ‘Hope through Hoops’, underprivileged girls and boys in tribal areas of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Gujarat are taught life lessons through sport. Children develop character, confidence and team spirit that help them to excel in life. Inga Health Foundation aims at treating children who are born with cleft and craniofacial deformities. Through Inga, we sponsor treatment for the financially underprivileged. We aspire to put a smile on the faces of children and wish for them to have a normal life like everyone else. Makunda Hospital is located in a remote tribal region of Assam. By donating essential medical equipment and funding needy children, we help provide quality healthcare to patients from Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Parivaar works towards the overall development of underprivileged children in tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh. We aim to address issues such as nutrition and quality education, by helping build a school and providing nutritious meals and a holistic complementary education programme. SRCC Children’s Hospital combines paediatric medical experience with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure affordable, quality medical care for children.We have partnered with them to cater to poor families who can’t always afford appropriate medical care. We wish to ease their financial burden so that critical care can continue where required. Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) works towards providing financial assistance and mentoring support to students from the underprivileged sections of society, to pursue higher education. We enable these children to chase their dreams by funding their education. With Shreeja's “Football & Beyond” initiative, we empower young girls through sports-based development programs in tribal areas of Kolkata, West Bengal. We aspire to inculcate life-skills needed to bring marginalised sections into mainstream society. Work across India to create Impact We commit to conducting operations in a transparent manner - conforming to the highest ethical and moral standards. We comply with the law of the land in all countries that we operate in or choose to operate in. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and do not engage, encourage or transact with individuals or institutions who don’t comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) India. We refrain from carrying out any activity which may prove to be detrimental to people and communities. In all regions we operate in or communities we work with, we display culturally appropriate behaviour. We work with partners who abide by the law of the land. We do not discriminate our stakeholders based on religion, caste, creed, sex, race/nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation or political beliefs. We treat all our stakeholders with dignity and respect. We respect the confidentiality policy of our stakeholders and commit to upholding the same unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties. We would expect the same from our stakeholders/partners towards our confidentiality. We have been partnering with the Sachin Tendulkar foundation since the last two years. It has been a fruitful experience working with the foundation. It all started with a generous grant from the foundation through which we could expand our Neonatal Intensive Care Services. Last year, we were privileged to start the ROP screening services for the premature babies in our NICU. In addition to this, the foundation has been supporting a lot of children who come from poor socio economic strata, with their hospital expenses. We are grateful to the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all support and we wish them the best in the coming year. We highly value the support that we are receiving from Shri Sachin Tendulkar and his Foundation. We are overwhelmed by the magnanimity and the high empathy that their entire team shows with Parivaar's mission and practical constraints. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is one of our long standing partner of Ekam Foundation Mumbai. Our partnership has been of defined by respect and transparency and above all working together for the better of children healthcare solutions. As part of our partnership there is continuous challenge and opportunity to explore newer frontiers with greater impact. We are proud to be associated with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation over the last few years on the Hi 5 basketball excellence program for tribal children in Mumbai/ Kolkata. The SRT team is extremely professional and compassionate in structuring and supporting all aspects of the program – namely the children, coaches and basketball infrastructure. Anjali and Sachin are both personally involved and committed to sports, tribal children and girls. Their personal involvement and interaction with the tribal children and our team inspires us all to greater heights. We are looking forward to working together for many more years in taking these children to greater heights in sports and in life! Inga Health Foundation carries a privilege of working with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation in its endeavor to provide treatment to deformed kids. While IHF carries the support of several donors, Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been proactive, in understanding the foundation and its efforts, on a regular basis. Interactions with the team, and more specifically Dr.Anjali Tendulkar, provides the foundation a much needed assessment of its work, and, a platform to improvise its service and objectives. Dr Anjali Tendulkar, being a medical professional, has taken significant interest in understanding the foundation, and her participation in the meeting, has been highly rewarding. We on behalf of Inga Health Foundation, are truly privileged to work alongside with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, treating children born with birth deformities of the skull and face, free of cost. Our job is that much easier to communicate with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, as Dr.Anjali Tendulkar is herself an eminent pediatrician . Her deep understanding of the nature of deformities, allows us to communicate and collaborate to high professional standards. I thank Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all the support. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the very esteemed Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for giving us an opportunity to collaborate and work with them . It has taken our organization to a different league. It has personally made me feel 10 folds more confident in the work Inga Health Foundation offers to mankind, and, has made me and our surgical team feel proud of the work we do. In simple words " We Must Be doing Something Right " to be under the agesis of Sachin Tendulkar Foundation and deserve their benevolence. Was humbled when Dr.Anjali Tendulkar herself participated in our very first meeting, to understand about Inga Health foundation and its activities. One of the finest gestures i have ever witnessed till date. Truly obliged and privileged. Once the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation team was convinced about our credentials, they have very actively and enthusiastically supported our initiative. We together have been able to scale up the positive impact on the lives of most deserving students in fulfilling their higher education dreams and helping their families in coming out of a poverty trap. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been supporting poor and needy patients at the SRCC Children’s Hospital for several years. We have utilised these generous funds for critically ill children who have had catastrophic and sudden onset of very serious illness. Parents are unprepared for the enormous financial burden of modern medicine and the combined stress of illness and finance is usually overwhelming. The funds from STF go a long way in alleviating some of this burden. Over a hundred children with complex problems and advanced surgical interventions have benefitted from the generosity of the foundation.

The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation was created to give a platform to bring together people, institutions and resources who are passionate about bringing a social change. The foundation will help us give equal opportunity to children and create a better world for our children. - Sachin Tendulkar I feel blessed. As a child, I was surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped me achieve my dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for our nation. The tremendous support I received over the years from all has made me who I am. In my second innings, I want to give back to the nation which I served proudly. We often speak about making the world a better place for our children. By focussing on children’s health, education and sports – we can create a positive difference to their present and future. The Foundation is a step in continuing my contribution to society. By working together, we can create a difference. Let’s nurture a billion dreams and let our youth excel. - Sachin Tendulkar The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation works with institutions and municipal hospitals that provide quality healthcare at affordable costs to underprivileged children. We focus on nutrition, preventative measures and work to improve access to healthcare for children. If dreams do not discriminate, then why should we? Every child is important and should have the opportunity and the right to receive a good quality education. The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation aims to work with partners who help children who come from underprivileged sections of society, and help them chase their dreams. Sport does not differentiate once we enter the arena. It’s a level-playing field that allows everyone to flourish and prepares the individuals for various life skills. Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. Through Ekam Foundation Mumbai, we endeavour to provide financial assistance for child healthcare to underprivileged sections of society, in government and trust hospitals. Through a basketball excellence program called ‘Hope through Hoops’, underprivileged girls and boys in tribal areas of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Gujarat are taught life lessons through sport. Children develop character, confidence and team spirit that help them to excel in life. Inga Health Foundation aims at treating children who are born with cleft and craniofacial deformities. Through Inga, we sponsor treatment for the financially underprivileged. We aspire to put a smile on the faces of children and wish for them to have a normal life like everyone else. Makunda Hospital is located in a remote tribal region of Assam. By donating essential medical equipment and funding needy children, we help provide quality healthcare to patients from Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Parivaar works towards the overall development of underprivileged children in tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh. We aim to address issues such as nutrition and quality education, by helping build a school and providing nutritious meals and a holistic complementary education programme. SRCC Children’s Hospital combines paediatric medical experience with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure affordable, quality medical care for children.We have partnered with them to cater to poor families who can’t always afford appropriate medical care. We wish to ease their financial burden so that critical care can continue where required. Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) works towards providing financial assistance and mentoring support to students from the underprivileged sections of society, to pursue higher education. We enable these children to chase their dreams by funding their education. With Shreeja's “Football & Beyond” initiative, we empower young girls through sports-based development programs in tribal areas of Kolkata, West Bengal. We aspire to inculcate life-skills needed to bring marginalised sections into mainstream society. Work across India to create Impact We commit to conducting operations in a transparent manner - conforming to the highest ethical and moral standards. We comply with the law of the land in all countries that we operate in or choose to operate in. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and do not engage, encourage or transact with individuals or institutions who don’t comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) India. We refrain from carrying out any activity which may prove to be detrimental to people and communities. In all regions we operate in or communities we work with, we display culturally appropriate behaviour. We work with partners who abide by the law of the land. We do not discriminate our stakeholders based on religion, caste, creed, sex, race/nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation or political beliefs. We treat all our stakeholders with dignity and respect. We respect the confidentiality policy of our stakeholders and commit to upholding the same unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties. We would expect the same from our stakeholders/partners towards our confidentiality. We have been partnering with the Sachin Tendulkar foundation since the last two years. It has been a fruitful experience working with the foundation. It all started with a generous grant from the foundation through which we could expand our Neonatal Intensive Care Services. Last year, we were privileged to start the ROP screening services for the premature babies in our NICU. In addition to this, the foundation has been supporting a lot of children who come from poor socio economic strata, with their hospital expenses. We are grateful to the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all support and we wish them the best in the coming year. We highly value the support that we are receiving from Shri Sachin Tendulkar and his Foundation. We are overwhelmed by the magnanimity and the high empathy that their entire team shows with Parivaar's mission and practical constraints. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is one of our long standing partner of Ekam Foundation Mumbai. Our partnership has been of defined by respect and transparency and above all working together for the better of children healthcare solutions. As part of our partnership there is continuous challenge and opportunity to explore newer frontiers with greater impact. We are proud to be associated with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation over the last few years on the Hi 5 basketball excellence program for tribal children in Mumbai/ Kolkata. The SRT team is extremely professional and compassionate in structuring and supporting all aspects of the program – namely the children, coaches and basketball infrastructure. Anjali and Sachin are both personally involved and committed to sports, tribal children and girls. Their personal involvement and interaction with the tribal children and our team inspires us all to greater heights. We are looking forward to working together for many more years in taking these children to greater heights in sports and in life! Inga Health Foundation carries a privilege of working with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation in its endeavor to provide treatment to deformed kids. While IHF carries the support of several donors, Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been proactive, in understanding the foundation and its efforts, on a regular basis. Interactions with the team, and more specifically Dr.Anjali Tendulkar, provides the foundation a much needed assessment of its work, and, a platform to improvise its service and objectives. Dr Anjali Tendulkar, being a medical professional, has taken significant interest in understanding the foundation, and her participation in the meeting, has been highly rewarding. We on behalf of Inga Health Foundation, are truly privileged to work alongside with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, treating children born with birth deformities of the skull and face, free of cost. Our job is that much easier to communicate with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, as Dr.Anjali Tendulkar is herself an eminent pediatrician . Her deep understanding of the nature of deformities, allows us to communicate and collaborate to high professional standards. I thank Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all the support. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the very esteemed Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for giving us an opportunity to collaborate and work with them . It has taken our organization to a different league. It has personally made me feel 10 folds more confident in the work Inga Health Foundation offers to mankind, and, has made me and our surgical team feel proud of the work we do. In simple words " We Must Be doing Something Right " to be under the agesis of Sachin Tendulkar Foundation and deserve their benevolence. Was humbled when Dr.Anjali Tendulkar herself participated in our very first meeting, to understand about Inga Health foundation and its activities. One of the finest gestures i have ever witnessed till date. Truly obliged and privileged. Once the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation team was convinced about our credentials, they have very actively and enthusiastically supported our initiative. We together have been able to scale up the positive impact on the lives of most deserving students in fulfilling their higher education dreams and helping their families in coming out of a poverty trap. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been supporting poor and needy patients at the SRCC Children’s Hospital for several years. We have utilised these generous funds for critically ill children who have had catastrophic and sudden onset of very serious illness. Parents are unprepared for the enormous financial burden of modern medicine and the combined stress of illness and finance is usually overwhelming. The funds from STF go a long way in alleviating some of this burden. Over a hundred children with complex problems and advanced surgical interventions have benefitted from the generosity of the foundation. We, at the SRCC Children’s hospital are ever grateful for the continuing support of Anjali and Sachin Tendulkar.

Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. Through Ekam Foundation Mumbai, we endeavour to provide financial assistance for child healthcare to underprivileged sections of society, in government and trust hospitals. Through a basketball excellence program called ‘Hope through Hoops’, underprivileged girls and boys in tribal areas of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Gujarat are taught life lessons through sport. Children develop character, confidence and team spirit that help them to excel in life. Inga Health Foundation aims at treating children who are born with cleft and craniofacial deformities. Through Inga, we sponsor treatment for the financially underprivileged. We aspire to put a smile on the faces of children and wish for them to have a normal life like everyone else. Makunda Hospital is located in a remote tribal region of Assam. By donating essential medical equipment and funding needy children, we help provide quality healthcare to patients from Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Parivaar works towards the overall development of underprivileged children in tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh. We aim to address issues such as nutrition and quality education, by helping build a school and providing nutritious meals and a holistic complementary education programme. SRCC Children’s Hospital combines paediatric medical experience with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure affordable, quality medical care for children.We have partnered with them to cater to poor families who can’t always afford appropriate medical care. We wish to ease their financial burden so that critical care can continue where required. Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) works towards providing financial assistance and mentoring support to students from the underprivileged sections of society, to pursue higher education. We enable these children to chase their dreams by funding their education. With Shreeja's “Football & Beyond” initiative, we empower young girls through sports-based development programs in tribal areas of Kolkata, West Bengal. We aspire to inculcate life-skills needed to bring marginalised sections into mainstream society. Work across India to create Impact We commit to conducting operations in a transparent manner - conforming to the highest ethical and moral standards. We comply with the law of the land in all countries that we operate in or choose to operate in. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and do not engage, encourage or transact with individuals or institutions who don’t comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) India.

We treat all our stakeholders with dignity and respect. We respect the confidentiality policy of our stakeholders and commit to upholding the same unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties. We would expect the same from our stakeholders/partners towards our confidentiality. We have been partnering with the Sachin Tendulkar foundation since the last two years. It has been a fruitful experience working with the foundation. It all started with a generous grant from the foundation through which we could expand our Neonatal Intensive Care Services. Last year, we were privileged to start the ROP screening services for the premature babies in our NICU. In addition to this, the foundation has been supporting a lot of children who come from poor socio economic strata, with their hospital expenses. We are grateful to the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all support and we wish them the best in the coming year. We highly value the support that we are receiving from Shri Sachin Tendulkar and his Foundation. We are overwhelmed by the magnanimity and the high empathy that their entire team shows with Parivaar's mission and practical constraints. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is one of our long standing partner of Ekam Foundation Mumbai. Our partnership has been of defined by respect and transparency and above all working together for the better of children healthcare solutions. As part of our partnership there is continuous challenge and opportunity to explore newer frontiers with greater impact. We are proud to be associated with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation over the last few years on the Hi 5 basketball excellence program for tribal children in Mumbai/ Kolkata. The SRT team is extremely professional and compassionate in structuring and supporting all aspects of the program – namely the children, coaches and basketball infrastructure. Anjali and Sachin are both personally involved and committed to sports, tribal children and girls. Their personal involvement and interaction with the tribal children and our team inspires us all to greater heights. We are looking forward to working together for many more years in taking these children to greater heights in sports and in life! Inga Health Foundation carries a privilege of working with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation in its endeavor to provide treatment to deformed kids. While IHF carries the support of several donors, Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been proactive, in understanding the foundation and its efforts, on a regular basis. Interactions with the team, and more specifically Dr.Anjali Tendulkar, provides the foundation a much needed assessment of its work, and, a platform to improvise its service and objectives. Dr Anjali Tendulkar, being a medical professional, has taken significant interest in understanding the foundation, and her participation in the meeting, has been highly rewarding. We on behalf of Inga Health Foundation, are truly privileged to work alongside with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, treating children born with birth deformities of the skull and face, free of cost. Our job is that much easier to communicate with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, as Dr.Anjali Tendulkar is herself an eminent pediatrician . Her deep understanding of the nature of deformities, allows us to communicate and collaborate to high professional standards. I thank Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all the support. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the very esteemed Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for giving us an opportunity to collaborate and work with them . It has taken our organization to a different league. It has personally made me feel 10 folds more confident in the work Inga Health Foundation offers to mankind, and, has made me and our surgical team feel proud of the work we do. In simple words " We Must Be doing Something Right " to be under the agesis of Sachin Tendulkar Foundation and deserve their benevolence. Was humbled when Dr.Anjali Tendulkar herself participated in our very first meeting, to understand about Inga Health foundation and its activities. One of the finest gestures i have ever witnessed till date. Truly obliged and privileged. Once the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation team was convinced about our credentials, they have very actively and enthusiastically supported our initiative. We together have been able to scale up the positive impact on the lives of most deserving students in fulfilling their higher education dreams and helping their families in coming out of a poverty trap. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been supporting poor and needy patients at the SRCC Children’s Hospital for several years. We have utilised these generous funds for critically ill children who have had catastrophic and sudden onset of very serious illness. Parents are unprepared for the enormous financial burden of modern medicine and the combined stress of illness and finance is usually overwhelming. The funds from STF go a long way in alleviating some of this burden. Over a hundred children with complex problems and advanced surgical interventions have benefitted from the generosity of the foundation.

The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation was created to give a platform to bring together people, institutions and resources who are passionate about bringing a social change. The foundation will help us give equal opportunity to children and create a better world for our children. - Sachin Tendulkar I feel blessed. As a child, I was surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped me achieve my dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for our nation. The tremendous support I received over the years from all has made me who I am. In my second innings, I want to give back to the nation which I served proudly. We often speak about making the world a better place for our children. By focussing on children’s health, education and sports – we can create a positive difference to their present and future. The Foundation is a step in continuing my contribution to society. By working together, we can create a difference. Let’s nurture a billion dreams and let our youth excel. - Sachin Tendulkar The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation works with institutions and municipal hospitals that provide quality healthcare at affordable costs to underprivileged children. We focus on nutrition, preventative measures and work to improve access to healthcare for children. If dreams do not discriminate, then why should we?

Last year, we were privileged to start the ROP screening services for the premature babies in our NICU. In addition to this, the foundation has been supporting a lot of children who come from poor socio economic strata, with their hospital expenses. We are grateful to the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all support and we wish them the best in the coming year. We highly value the support that we are receiving from Shri Sachin Tendulkar and his Foundation. We are overwhelmed by the magnanimity and the high empathy that their entire team shows with Parivaar's mission and practical constraints. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is one of our long standing partner of Ekam Foundation Mumbai. Our partnership has been of defined by respect and transparency and above all working together for the better of children healthcare solutions. As part of our partnership there is continuous challenge and opportunity to explore newer frontiers with greater impact. We are proud to be associated with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation over the last few years on the Hi 5 basketball excellence program for tribal children in Mumbai/ Kolkata. The SRT team is extremely professional and compassionate in structuring and supporting all aspects of the program – namely the children, coaches and basketball infrastructure. Anjali and Sachin are both personally involved and committed to sports, tribal children and girls. Their personal involvement and interaction with the tribal children and our team inspires us all to greater heights. We are looking forward to working together for many more years in taking these children to greater heights in sports and in life! Inga Health Foundation carries a privilege of working with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation in its endeavor to provide treatment to deformed kids. While IHF carries the support of several donors, Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been proactive, in understanding the foundation and its efforts, on a regular basis. Interactions with the team, and more specifically Dr.Anjali Tendulkar, provides the foundation a much needed assessment of its work, and, a platform to improvise its service and objectives. Dr Anjali Tendulkar, being a medical professional, has taken significant interest in understanding the foundation, and her participation in the meeting, has been highly rewarding. We on behalf of Inga Health Foundation, are truly privileged to work alongside with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, treating children born with birth deformities of the skull and face, free of cost. Our job is that much easier to communicate with Sachin Tendulkar Foundation, as Dr.Anjali Tendulkar is herself an eminent pediatrician . Her deep understanding of the nature of deformities, allows us to communicate and collaborate to high professional standards. I thank Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for all the support. I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the very esteemed Sachin Tendulkar Foundation for giving us an opportunity to collaborate and work with them . It has taken our organization to a different league. It has personally made me feel 10 folds more confident in the work Inga Health Foundation offers to mankind, and, has made me and our surgical team feel proud of the work we do. In simple words " We Must Be doing Something Right " to be under the agesis of Sachin Tendulkar Foundation and deserve their benevolence. Was humbled when Dr.Anjali Tendulkar herself participated in our very first meeting, to understand about Inga Health foundation and its activities. One of the finest gestures i have ever witnessed till date. Truly obliged and privileged. Once the Sachin Tendulkar Foundation team was convinced about our credentials, they have very actively and enthusiastically supported our initiative. We together have been able to scale up the positive impact on the lives of most deserving students in fulfilling their higher education dreams and helping their families in coming out of a poverty trap. Sachin Tendulkar Foundation has been supporting poor and needy patients at the SRCC Children’s Hospital for several years. We have utilised these generous funds for critically ill children who have had catastrophic and sudden onset of very serious illness. Parents are unprepared for the enormous financial burden of modern medicine and the combined stress of illness and finance is usually overwhelming. The funds from STF go a long way in alleviating some of this burden. Over a hundred children with complex problems and advanced surgical interventions have benefitted from the generosity of the foundation. We, at the SRCC Children’s hospital are ever grateful for the continuing support of Anjali and Sachin Tendulkar.

The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation was created to give a platform to bring together people, institutions and resources who are passionate about bringing a social change. The foundation will help us give equal opportunity to children and create a better world for our children. - Sachin Tendulkar I feel blessed. As a child, I was surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped me achieve my dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for our nation. The tremendous support I received over the years from all has made me who I am. In my second innings, I want to give back to the nation which I served proudly. We often speak about making the world a better place for our children. By focussing on children’s health, education and sports – we can create a positive difference to their present and future. The Foundation is a step in continuing my contribution to society. By working together, we can create a difference. Let’s nurture a billion dreams and let our youth excel. - Sachin Tendulkar The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation works with institutions and municipal hospitals that provide quality healthcare at affordable costs to underprivileged children. We focus on nutrition, preventative measures and work to improve access to healthcare for children. If dreams do not discriminate, then why should we? Every child is important and should have the opportunity and the right to receive a good quality education. The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation aims to work with partners who help children who come from underprivileged sections of society, and help them chase their dreams. Sport does not differentiate once we enter the arena. It’s a level-playing field that allows everyone to flourish and prepares the individuals for various life skills. Sports as a leveller teaches us how to deal with success and failure. Through Ekam Foundation Mumbai, we endeavour to provide financial assistance for child healthcare to underprivileged sections of society, in government and trust hospitals. Through a basketball excellence program called ‘Hope through Hoops’, underprivileged girls and boys in tribal areas of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Gujarat are taught life lessons through sport. Children develop character, confidence and team spirit that help them to excel in life. Inga Health Foundation aims at treating children who are born with cleft and craniofacial deformities. Through Inga, we sponsor treatment for the financially underprivileged. We aspire to put a smile on the faces of children and wish for them to have a normal life like everyone else. Makunda Hospital is located in a remote tribal region of Assam. By donating essential medical equipment and funding needy children, we help provide quality healthcare to patients from Assam, Mizoram and Tripura. Parivaar works towards the overall development of underprivileged children in tribal communities of Madhya Pradesh. We aim to address issues such as nutrition and quality education, by helping build a school and providing nutritious meals and a holistic complementary education programme. SRCC Children’s Hospital combines paediatric medical experience with state-of-the-art facilities to ensure affordable, quality medical care for children.We have partnered with them to cater to poor families who can’t always afford appropriate medical care. We wish to ease their financial burden so that critical care can continue where required. Vidyarthi Vikas Yojna (VVY) works towards providing financial assistance and mentoring support to students from the underprivileged sections of society, to pursue higher education. We enable these children to chase their dreams by funding their education. With Shreeja's “Football & Beyond” initiative, we empower young girls through sports-based development programs in tribal areas of Kolkata, West Bengal. We aspire to inculcate life-skills needed to bring marginalised sections into mainstream society. Work across India to create Impact We commit to conducting operations in a transparent manner - conforming to the highest ethical and moral standards. We comply with the law of the land in all countries that we operate in or choose to operate in. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to bribery and corruption. We maintain a zero-tolerance approach to money laundering and do not engage, encourage or transact with individuals or institutions who don’t comply with the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) India. We refrain from carrying out any activity which may prove to be detrimental to people and communities. In all regions we operate in or communities we work with, we display culturally appropriate behaviour. We work with partners who abide by the law of the land. We do not discriminate our stakeholders based on religion, caste, creed, sex, race/nationality, gender identity, sexual orientation or political beliefs. We treat all our stakeholders with dignity and respect. We respect the confidentiality policy of our stakeholders and commit to upholding the same unless explicitly agreed upon by both parties. We would expect the same from our stakeholders/partners towards our confidentiality. We have been partnering with the Sachin Tendulkar foundation since the last two years.

SRT Sports Management Pvt. Ltd. (SRTSM) is a premier sports management organisation that represents one of India’s most-reputed cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar. Founded by Dr. Anjali Tendulkar and the Master Blaster himself, the organisation manages all social and commercial engagements involving the Cricket icon. SRT Sports Management Pvt. Ltd. manages brand and persona ‘Sachin’ and oversees all his social initiatives and commercial engagements. Our organisation fosters close-knit, long-term partnerships with numerous brands, working alongside them to unlock and maximise their potential value. To build and sustain positive impact on society through social and brand partnerships, and continue Sachin Tendulkar’s legacy by leveraging our key values of Trust, Transparency and Performance. Reaffirming trust by following through on our every commitment. Delivering value through transparent brand celebrity associations. Ensuring seamless value alignment between the brand and celebrity. We are known for taking decisions that are fair and honest and are recognised for transparency in our dealings. We say what we mean. We never over promise to sign up business. We do what we say. We work with agility for both internal and external customers. We strive to deliver ahead of time every time. Team for us means our internal as well as the client’s team. We work with clients, owning their objectives as our own without diluting our own. When envisioning the logo for brand SRTSM, there was no better fit than Sachin himself. Depicted in our logo is a silhouette of Sachin playing a shot, his jersey number 10 is downplayed in hue to represent the humility with which he has always conducted himself. In stark contrast, is the tricolour that beams out from the swing of his bat, depicting that every stroke he played was with one end-game in mind … to represent his country and make India proud. An aim that he sees through till today. Co-founder Head - Accounts & Compliance Head - Office administration and Executive secretary Senior Manager – Corporate & Social Initiatives Vice President Vice President How do you differentiate sponsoring marathons to gain visibility, when every city has 3 or more already? The simple answer is get Sachin Tendulkar as the face of your marathons...no brainer. Sachin raised our marathons to a different level. The hysteria he creates, and the crowds he pulls, has to be seen to be believed ... even 5 years after retirement !!! What to my mind is more important is the absolute professionalism he displays and how he works hard to create a chemistry and comfort with the brand. Luminous’ long standing relationship of around 8 years is a true reflection of our respect for Sachin and what he stands for in terms of values. Sachin stands for trust, dependability, high performance, professionalism and reliability - exactly the values that we wanted brand Luminous to have. We are very proud of this association with Sachin, as it has successfully communicated these values to our customers and consumers, and also has motivated us internally to ensure we are committed to these values. This association has made us grow our business and build our brand. Personally, I have enjoyed our journey with Sachin and found him very warm and actively engaged in our initiatives, and always encouraging us. Our ongoing association with SRTSM has been a wonderful experience from day one. The professionalism of the team, combined with a deep understanding of the brands they represent, presented us with the perfect opportunity to create value in a finite amount of time. A truly fulfilling and enriching business experience. To have someone like Sachin Tendulkar backing you when you are starting off is an adrenaline boost in itself. We've had a great partnership with Sachin and Anjali, and the entire team at SRTSM in building USPL; they've always supported the company and the team. Having someone like him on board always keeps the bar high and pushes us to deliver higher. hello@srt10.in © 2023 SRT10. All rights reserved.

We are very proud of this association with Sachin, as it has successfully communicated these values to our customers and consumers, and also has motivated us internally to ensure we are committed to these values. This association has made us grow our business and build our brand. Personally, I have enjoyed our journey with Sachin and found him very warm and actively engaged in our initiatives, and always encouraging us. Our ongoing association with SRTSM has been a wonderful experience from day one. The professionalism of the team, combined with a deep understanding of the brands they represent, presented us with the perfect opportunity to create value in a finite amount of time. A truly fulfilling and enriching business experience. To have someone like Sachin Tendulkar backing you when you are starting off is an adrenaline boost in itself. We've had a great partnership with Sachin and Anjali, and the entire team at SRTSM in building USPL; they've always supported the company and the team. Having someone like him on board always keeps the bar high and pushes us to deliver higher. hello@srt10.in © 2023 SRT10. All rights reserved.

SRT Sports Management Pvt. Ltd. (SRTSM) is a premier sports management organisation that represents one of India’s most-reputed cricketers, Sachin Tendulkar. Founded by Dr. Anjali Tendulkar and the Master Blaster himself, the organisation manages all social and commercial engagements involving the Cricket icon. SRT Sports Management Pvt. Ltd. manages brand and persona ‘Sachin’ and oversees all his social initiatives and commercial engagements. Our organisation fosters close-knit, long-term partnerships with numerous brands, working alongside them to unlock and maximise their potential value. To build and sustain positive impact on society through social and brand partnerships, and continue Sachin Tendulkar’s legacy by leveraging our key values of Trust, Transparency and Performance. Reaffirming trust by following through on our every commitment. Delivering value through transparent brand celebrity associations. Ensuring seamless value alignment between the brand and celebrity. We are known for taking decisions that are fair and honest and are recognised for transparency in our dealings. We say what we mean. We never over promise to sign up business. We do what we say. We work with agility for both internal and external customers. We strive to deliver ahead of time every time. Team for us means our internal as well as the client’s team. We work with clients, owning their objectives as our own without diluting our own. When envisioning the logo for brand SRTSM, there was no better fit than Sachin himself. Depicted in our logo is a silhouette of Sachin playing a shot, his jersey number 10 is downplayed in hue to represent the humility with which he has always conducted himself. In stark contrast, is the tricolour that beams out from the swing of his bat, depicting that every stroke he played was with one end-game in mind … to represent his country and make India proud. An aim that he sees through till today. Co-founder Head - Accounts & Compliance Head - Office administration and Executive secretary Senior Manager – Corporate & Social Initiatives Vice President Vice President How do you differentiate sponsoring marathons to gain visibility, when every city has 3 or more already? The simple answer is get Sachin Tendulkar as the face of your marathons...no brainer. Sachin raised our marathons to a different level. The hysteria he creates, and the crowds he pulls, has to be seen to be believed ... even 5 years after retirement !!! What to my mind is more important is the absolute professionalism he displays and how he works hard to create a chemistry and comfort with the brand.

Co-founder Head - Accounts & Compliance Head - Office administration and Executive secretary Senior Manager – Corporate & Social Initiatives Vice President Vice President How do you differentiate sponsoring marathons to gain visibility, when every city has 3 or more already? The simple answer is get Sachin Tendulkar as the face of your marathons...no brainer. Sachin raised our marathons to a different level. The hysteria he creates, and the crowds he pulls, has to be seen to be believed ... even 5 years after retirement !!! What to my mind is more important is the absolute professionalism he displays and how he works hard to create a chemistry and comfort with the brand. Luminous’ long standing relationship of around 8 years is a true reflection of our respect for Sachin and what he stands for in terms of values. Sachin stands for trust, dependability, high performance, professionalism and reliability - exactly the values that we wanted brand Luminous to have. We are very proud of this association with Sachin, as it has successfully communicated these values to our customers and consumers, and also has motivated us internally to ensure we are committed to these values. This association has made us grow our business and build our brand. Personally, I have enjoyed our journey with Sachin and found him very warm and actively engaged in our initiatives, and always encouraging us. Our ongoing association with SRTSM has been a wonderful experience from day one. The professionalism of the team, combined with a deep understanding of the brands they represent, presented us with the perfect opportunity to create value in a finite amount of time. A truly fulfilling and enriching business experience. To have someone like Sachin Tendulkar backing you when you are starting off is an adrenaline boost in itself. We've had a great partnership with Sachin and Anjali, and the entire team at SRTSM in building USPL; they've always supported the company and the team. Having someone like him on board always keeps the bar high and pushes us to deliver higher. hello@srt10.in © 2023 SRT10. All rights reserved.

Just 15 when he stepped out on to the field to represent India, Sachin is today synonymous with everything Cricket. As a result of his exploits on the field, and conduct off the field, he transformed from cricketer to icon to role model for multiple generations; earning the moniker ‘Master Blaster’ at the age of just 24. Loved and adored by fans across the world from every community, age and gender, he was one of the first sportsmen to truly become a global Cricket sensation; someone who brought Cricket into the spotlight every time he took to the crease. Sachin Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973 in Dadar (Mumbai) At the tender age of 16, Tendulkar made his international debut in Tests and ODIs, becoming the youngest cricketer to play for India. Saving a Test match for India in Manchester, 17-year-old Sachin celebrated his maiden Test century, becoming India’s youngest Test centurion. With 523 runs including two centuries, Tendulkar ended the 1996 World cup as the leading run-getter of the tournament Enjoying a dream run, Sachin amassed 1894 ODI runs in a single year. His twin centuries against Australia in Sharjah (143 and 134) helped India win the Coca-Cola Cup. The innings of 143 was briefly interrupted by a desert storm. Post resumption, Sachin launched a memorable attack on the Australians. Tendulkar became the first batsman to score 10,000 runs in ODI cricket! In Delhi, Sachin scored his 35th Test century and became the highest century maker in Test cricket. Tendulkar went past Brian Lara’s record tally of 11,953 Test runs to become the highest run-getter in the longest format. Feb – Scoring 200* against South Africa, Sachin became the first-ever double centurion in Men’s ODIs. Oct – Sachin won the ICC cricketer of the Year Award. Dec - In Centurion, Sachin brought up his 50th Test century – the only cricketer to score these many. Tendulkar fulfilled his lifelong dream of lifting the World Cup Trophy as India beat Sri Lanka in the final at Mumbai. With 482 runs including two centuries, he was also India’s highest run-getter in the tournament and the 2nd-highest across teams. A milestone no one could have imagined, Sachin scored his 100th hundred in international cricket. Drawing curtains on a glorious career, Tendulkar exited the field in front of his home crowd in Mumbai. Sachin received the prestigious Bharat Ratna award, making him India's first sportsperson and the youngest person to receive the award. Sachin Tendulkar has been surrounded by a loving family, friends and mentors. Their support, along with the unconditional love of sports fans worldwide, helped him achieve his dream of playing for India and winning the World Cup for the nation.  The tremendous support he received over the years from fans all over has made him who he is today. Sachin wanted to give back to the nation that has supported him throughout his journey. The Sachin Tendulkar Foundation is a platform created to bring together people, institutions and resources who are passionate about bringing social change. The foundation attempts to serve children and give them a better tomorrow. hello@srt10.in © 2023 SRT10. All rights reserved.

Just 15 when he stepped out on to the field to represent India, Sachin is today synonymous with everything Cricket. As a result of his exploits on the field, and conduct off the field, he transformed from cricketer to icon to role model for multiple generations; earning the moniker ‘Master Blaster’ at the age of just 24. Loved and adored by fans across the world from every community, age and gender, he was one of the first sportsmen to truly become a global Cricket sensation; someone who brought Cricket into the spotlight every time he took to the crease. Sachin Tendulkar was born on April 24, 1973 in Dadar (Mumbai) At the tender age of 16, Tendulkar made his international debut in Tests and ODIs, becoming the youngest cricketer to play for India. Saving a Test match for India in Manchester, 17-year-old Sachin celebrated his maiden Test century, becoming India’s youngest Test centurion. With 523 runs including two centuries, Tendulkar ended the 1996 World cup as the leading run-getter of the tournament Enjoying a dream run, Sachin amassed 1894 ODI runs in a single year. His twin centuries against Australia in Sharjah (143 and 134) helped India win the Coca-Cola Cup. The innings of 143 was briefly interrupted by a desert storm.
